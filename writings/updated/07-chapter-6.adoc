== Chapter VI. Love to the Lost / And a Hand held forth to the Helpless / to Lead out of the Dark

[.emphasized.centered]
Wherein is plainly held out:
Several particular things, as they are learned of Christ;
and are most needful to be known by all who profess godliness;
Set forth chiefly to direct the simple into the living way of Truth,
as it is in Jesus Christ the Righteous,
that therein they may come to the life and power
of that which the world has only in words;
which being received, satisfies the weary soul,
and makes the creature well-pleasing to his Maker.

We have found Him whom our soul loves; And greater is He in us than he that is in the world.

=== Let Him that Reads Understand

Friends, the following things which I have declared are not things of man,
nor did I receive them by man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ,
which is contrary to the wisdom and will of man.
Nor do I commend them to be received by the wisdom and will of man,
for the natural man`'s wisdom receives not the things of the Spirit of God,
and would eagerly devour that which is born thereof.
So to that wisdom I do not appeal, and it is a small thing to me to be judged thereby.
But if anyone knows the gift of God,
and a measure of that Spirit which opens the bosom of
the Father and reveals His secrets to babes,
the least measure of that (if not clouded with imaginations) will savor these things,
and to such they may be profitable.
So to the light of Christ in all (that which changes not,
and is one in both male and female) I present this to be judged and discerned.
For only in the light will both these things, and all others that proceed from the Root,
work to gather together into that one Name and Seed
wherein all the nations of the earth are blessed.
Yes, it is by the light of Christ that men are gathered into
the one Word of faith and power of life,
to believe and speak the same things in godly conduct,
which leads to the end of all schisms, heresies and errors, sects and divisions,
and to be baptized into the one name, where the fullness of God is blessed forever.

So whoever you are who shall read the following particulars,
and shall find anything therein which for the present you cannot receive;
be not hasty in judging what you do not yet know,
nor kick against that which seems contrary to your will,
lest you put far from you (in your own will) that which
you may not be able to call to you again,
and lest the day of your visitation pass over unaware,
and in the day of trial you are made to cry out, "`How I have hated instruction,
and resisted the day of healing!`"

And know this: that no prophesy of old came by the will of man,
nor could it be received by the will of man;
but it was ever resisted by those who stood in their own wills,
and so it will be in these things, unless you read them with the eye that never changes.
And if you know such an eye in you, and stand single therein in the meek Spirit,
not lifted up above your measure,
you will come to feel how the gift of God in you answers to the things of God,
as face answers to face in a mirror.
And you will find them also to agree with the life of the Scriptures,
though for the present some things may appear darkly;
for my service is unto that seed which is not of this world,
which savors spiritually and judges not according to outward appearance.

=== Concerning the Fall of Man

In the beginning God made all things good.
Man too was created good, in the image of God,
who placed in him His own wisdom and power,
whereby man was completely furnished with dominion,
power and authority over the works of God`'s hands,
knowing the nature and use of each creature because of
that which God had placed in him of Himself.
In this state, Adam was a son of God, whose seed was in himself.

God also
placed the tree of life in the midst of the garden,
and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
and both of these were good in their place,
but the tree of knowledge was not good for food.
Therefore, He that made it forewarned them of feeding upon it,
as being that wherein they would find death, even as in the other tree there was life.
Herein was the blessing and the curse, the life and the death,
the obedience and the disobedience, the election and reprobation.
All of this was good in its place, while man stood in his place,
guided by Him who placed him in the good, and forewarned him of the knowledge,
and gave him power against it.
Yes, he was safe while he stood in that will which had set all these things in their place,
which will was free for God, and free from sin;
and here the will of God and the will of man were one,
and so were at unity with all the creation.

But when man looked out of his domain (to where
one ruled who abode not in the truth),
then disobedience was received in,
and that which was contrary to the will of God was fed upon,
and so man joined to that which was contrary, wherein there is weakness, death,
darkness and blindness with respect to the things of God and what he had received of Him.
Then man grew subtle within himself, and wise to do evil.
He lost the will that was free to wait upon God for
wisdom and counsel to be freely carried forth by Him;
and so fell from uprightness and innocency, and pure wisdom and spiritual power,
which God had placed in his heart,
into self-ends and inventions which he had chosen in the contrary will.
Thus, entering into the forbidden thing, he became accursed,
lost his measure of God`'s grace,
lost God`'s honor and likeness in which he had stood above the creation,
and so became brutish in his understanding, and as to the things of God,
became as the beasts that perish.
For indeed, he lost the Seed wherein the election, the wisdom, the authority,
and all happiness (present and eternal) does consist, and so became led by another seed,
which God had cut off from Himself, and permitted to rise up for dishonor.

Here it is that man lost his dominion over the devil, by letting him in,
who otherwise never had power further than to offer and tempt.
But now, having got into the temple of God,
the principal part in man (by a show of God and godliness),
man has joined with him and become his captive, in whom the devil makes havoc,
beguiling him of the life of simplicity and godliness,
and perverting the ways and ends for which man was made.
And sin now having risen above and become ruler in the heart,
even the mercies of God given to the creature
are used for the lust that is carnal and selfish,
to which man has become a slave.
Alas, man has so lost his dominion that he is made a slave to
the creation over which he formerly was ruler.

So it is that men have become slaves and are captivated, some with covetousness,
some with pride, some with lust and many other things.
Yes, these become lords in the heart,
whereby he hurries with all eagerness out of all
moderation and hunts after vanity and folly.
Oh, what vain toys and foolish trifles have led away
the heart of man from the pure wisdom of his God,
till he scarce knows any end of chasing after changeable things,
gluttony and excess in diet (though he is never satisfied),
foolery in apparel without check or restraint,
being wholly fallen from that which is unchangeable,
and from true satisfaction and honor.
And the further a man goes into this state,
the more emptiness and darkness comes in upon him;
and being fallen under the earthly nature he is covered with thick darkness,
so that he knows neither the mind of God nor his own woeful state,
for the god of this world has blinded the eye which would show him his misery,
and stopped the ear which would hear the voice of the soul`'s shepherd,
whereby he would be quickened.
Yes, his eye and his ear are led out into carnal things and there taken captive,
so that the voice of the Spirit he knows not.

So then, having become blind of heart, such cannot receive the way of the Spirit,
and whatsoever is spoken to a man in this state (in
love to his soul which lies in death),
the serpent (having risen above in the man) seeks to steal into the imaginations,
whereby the creature is led to consult with him in the flesh.
In this way, man is beguiled of the simplicity and kept in self,
so that he regards not the Seed of God which is
pressed down under all this death and darkness.
And so long as the creature will hearken to the serpent and his lying promises,
he will be led from one outward thing to another,
but never to see that from which he has fallen.

Thus Christ and all His ministers preach
repentance to those who are in this state,
that all might turn their minds from these dead works to the living God, who is a Spirit,
who is known and worshipped in Spirit, whose kingdom is within,
and whose light is in the midst of all this darkness,
though the darkness does not comprehend it.
And as many as repent of following the way of self-wisdom and knowledge,
and come to stand still,
to such He shows His salvation and His kingdom near at hand (though
the serpent tells his followers it is far off).
And as the mind is stayed to wait for the kingdom of God in Spirit,
the god of the world is thereby denied and resisted;
and as the mind is stayed in the light, no longer hearkening to what is earthly,
the soul which lies in death comes to hear the voice of the Son of God,
and to receive life and strength from the Word, whereby it is raised out of the grave,
above the earthly part, to receive from the Father the dew of heaven,
whereby it is nourished and refreshed.
And as man beholds the seed growing,
so he comes to see the new creation and to understand what he lost in the fall,
and so is restored by the power of the Word, the Son of God, into His dominion,
power and purity, and made able to resist the devil,
to choose the thing that is good and delight in it,
even as before he delighted in the contrary.
Thus man comes to be reconciled to his maker in
the eternal unity beyond what words can express.
For the wisdom and power received from above sets the heart free from corruption,
enabling it to escape the pollutions of the world,
and to run in the pure path with delight,
which is the glorious liberty of the sons of God,
the resurrection in Christ from the death in Adam,
and the entrance into the everlasting rest.

And now, all who find yourselves fallen from your dominion,
from that measure of God`'s gift which He has placed in man,
and now find yourselves led captive by the evil one into the ways of death, sin and evil,
so that corruption has dominion in you and over you;
never look to be restored by that which led you out,
for that power which acts in the flesh is only evil continually.
This will lead you from mountain to hill, in self, in emptiness, without life and power,
seeking to heal yourselves in false persuasions, but will not stand in the day of trial,
for all of this is found in the first man with his righteousness.
But you must look to that from which you have fallen,
and return into that from which you have gone out,
that by the light that is in the midst of all this darkness
and death you may be led up again by the blood of the cross,
through the fire and the sword, into the garden of God, where He plants and feeds,
and where the old man (with all his will and works) cannot enter,
nor can he whose leader is any visible thing.
For man has fallen and gone out from the Spirit,
and so by the Spirit he must be led in again;
and that Seed which man has sinned against must make the peace, which Seed is free,
and sets all free, as they are born of it.

=== Concerning Light and Life

God is the life of every creature, though few there be that know it;
for the darkness sees neither Him nor His life,
though the children of darkness may speak His words from the Scriptures,
which were given forth from the light.
Yet such as these know not God to be present,
for the first appearing of God in the world is by light: God said,
"`Let there be light,`" and it was so.
And God saw that this light was good.
This is that which was in the beginning with God, and was the Word,
by which all things were made and seen, and without this nothing was made that was made,
nor was anything seen to be good.
Now darkness was over the face of all the waters until the light shone from the Word,
who is life, which life is said to be "`the light of men.`"^
footnote:[John 1:4]
So that none can see the life except by the light which
both comes from the life and leads back to it.
This was the light in the beginning, given to keep in order all the creation.
And though it shines in darkness, the darkness does not comprehend it;
and all who abide in darkness (not discerning the life
or being ordered and governed by light) are destroyed.

For all that go out of the light go into the darkness,
where the life and image of God are lost.
Here is the fall, and all who abide here are reserved in chains of darkness,
not knowing the life which can break the bonds and chains of
iniquity and open the grave and the prison door.
Here the soul remains in death with darkness risen above in man;
and in this darkness the creature is led into sects, opinions and errors,
chasing imaginations and running in his sensual wisdom further into death and darkness,
till he is so blinded in his understanding that he thinks he
does God service when he is acting against the life of God,
both in himself and others.
Hereby the creature comes wholly to be lost,
and the gospel which could recover him is hid from his eyes.
For though God did furnish the soul with a measure of life whereby to do His will,
yet now the god of this world has so blinded the mind,
and so far alienated him from the life of God,
that he has neither power nor life to do the will of God,
nor light to know where to find it.
But though he lacks life, the creature will continue in a profession of religion,
or some other lofty notion, in order to keep a vain hope of salvation.

Here is the sole ground and cause why there are so many sorts
of religious forms and opinions and ways to worship,
but none that do good, or live in what they say, because all have lost the life of God,
which alone is able to bring forth the righteousness of God.
Self takes hold of the outward form of religion
and holds it in the imagination above the life;
and the life (which lies oppressed beneath) cannot unite with the form,
but instead condemns it.
So that all the world lies in darkness; yes, thick darkness is upon all the seas;
and from here imaginations have spread over all,
so that none can witness the work of God,
neither do they know the beginning or end thereof.
This is the cause of condemnation,
and it rests upon all who have gone out of the life of God.

Now, there is no other way appointed of the Father to
come out of this condition but by Christ Jesus,
the light and life of men.
He is the light that is in the world, though the world knows Him not;
which light shines in darkness but cannot thereby be comprehended.
This light is the revealer of darkness, and manifests the deeds thereof.
Its very first appearance in the creature shows the darkness
of his condition and the captivity that exists in the darkness;
and without its shining,
the creature can never see the wretched condition that
man is in (without the life of God),
nor be willing to stand still to see God`'s salvation, but instead is full of vain hopes,
notions, and imaginations, the veil being over his heart, thinking himself to be whole,
and not in need of the Physician.
And with this blind heart the creature reads the Scriptures
and steals the promises that are spoken to the children of
light (who have the Seed to whom the promise was made),
though they know neither the law nor the Gospel.
No, they have not come so far as Moses, though they go on boasting of Christ.

But when the light is minded,
the creature comes to see that death is yet reigning,
and that self is alive without the law.
And with this light, all that has risen up above the life in the creature,
and defiled the soul, is seen and judged.
And here, that which has brought the soul into bondage can be seen,
and the hardness of heart can be felt,
and the cause of it known--even the great transgression of God`'s pure law.
Then the fear of God comes to take hold of the man that has lived
outside the life of God and taken pleasure in unrighteousness,
and the creature finds great trouble within,
even where the strong man had formerly kept a sort of peace in his house.
But abiding in the light, the cause and end of these things are seen;
and dwelling in the fear, wisdom is received from above to depart from iniquity;
and in departing from the iniquity, there is a drawing nearer to God,
so that His light grows and springs,
as there is a coming nearer to the just paths of life.
And as light arises yet further, the state of the creation is discerned,
how enmity has spread over, how lust has defiled it,
and how that which was planted a vineyard has become a wilderness for barrenness,
grown over with thorns and briars, strong oaks and tall cedars,
for lack of the Vine-dresser.
Yes, where the lily should grow, the soul is overgrown with weeds, thistles, and nettles,
so that God will not walk in the midst of so great an abomination.
And this is the cause of all of your woes--even His absence.

And when you can see this, then lamentation begins in the house of laughter,
even a mourning for Him from whom you have fallen.
But as you follow the light, and come nearer to the Lord from which it comes,
you will see that it has been your own wills and
ways that have separated you from the Holy One.
And with the light you will realize how often you have been
checked by the Spirit of light in the course of your evil ways;
and that the only cause why you have remained thus long in the
fall is because of self-will and worldly pleasures,
whereby the life of Christ within has suffered.
Not before this can any man see the One whom they have pierced, nor lament over Him,
nor see what it is that oppresses the Righteous One;
nor can they hate what God hates and love what God loves in any degree.
Instead, they join to that which destroys the soul and robs it of life,
being high-minded and lofty, having mouths that speak great things,
swelling words of vanity, empty brass, giving a pleasant sound to the carnal ear,
but have no evidence of the life of God or its work.

=== Concerning Righteousness

The righteousness which God accepts is but one, which is His own,
perfectly fulfilled and manifest in Christ Jesus, the light and Savior of the world.
This righteousness is not of the world,
nor can the world inherit it except as they believe in the light of Christ,
which God has given to lead out of the world unto Christ, where God`'s righteousness is.
Though there be many talkers of this righteousness,
yet none inherit it further than they receive the Son of righteousness by faith,
and with Him His righteousness is freely imputed,
being put into the creature as a free gift from the Father.
And with this righteousness the creature is truly made righteous,
even as He is righteous,
according as the measure of light from Christ is received,
and no further--the light which condemns all self-acting regardless of pretense,
so that "`as He was so are we in this present world.`"^
footnote:[1 John 4:17]

So he who abides in this righteousness,
abides in that which denies self and the world,
and lives in obedience to that which is contrary to man`'s will,
and so is everywhere spoken against.
For the will of man works not the righteousness of God;
but God`'s righteousness is wrought in the creature in
that obedience which is contrary to the will of the flesh.
And in the faith which comes from the eternal Spirit there is a new begetting,
both of the will and of the deed, so that what comes forth is Spirit and life.
So far as any have this righteousness, they do not lie under sin,
nor give place to the devil,
but know it to be a breastplate against all assaults on the right hand and on the left.

But you say your righteousness is as filthy rags.
I grant it; but why do you abide in that?
God`'s righteousness is not filthy rags.
Therefore, cease from your own righteousness, and know that which is perfect,
even the everlasting righteousness in which all His
saints have been gathered into Himself.
For God will receive nothing but what is His own, and it must be yours also,
else you cannot be received into Him.
It is in vain that you plow wickedness and sow iniquity,
and still think to reap righteousness.

With the light you may see what it is that works in you,
and to what you are yielding yourselves as servants.
And as you obey this righteousness, you shall see the spiritual man raised and living,
and the bonds of death broken, and that life which gives power over hell and death.
Then you may say, "`the Spirit is life because of righteousness.`"^
footnote:[Romans 8:10]

But many have made Christ`'s righteousness a cover for their abominations.
What wickedness now exists among the nations for which
Christ`'s righteousness has not been called a cover?
Yes, men bless themselves with a notion of Christ`'s
righteousness while they live in the greatest iniquity.
But know this: it is to cover your wickedness, pride,
and covetousness that your teachers invented this faith,
saying it is sufficient to believe in a righteousness that you read
about in the letter (though you are not obedient to it in spirit).
But those who are not servants of righteousness are no servants of Christ`'s;
and your faith, without His works, will be of little worth towards your salvation.
And this your consciences will one day witness: You can no more inherit righteousness,
or be made "`the righteousness of God in Christ`"^
footnote:[2 Corinthians 5:21]
further than you know the power of His righteousness working in you,
and you acknowledging it by obedience and subjection,
and joining to it against all unrighteousness.

And at that day when He comes to separate the precious from the vile,
then you will see what worth your notions of righteousness have,
when the worker of iniquity is found and judged who has
boasted of Christ`'s righteousness in words,
but known not its power.
For by the power and purity of righteousness all the
workers of iniquity shall be judged and condemned.
So do not deceive yourselves: "`he that works righteousness is righteous,
even as He is righteous;`"^
footnote:[1 John 3:7]
but he that talks of righteousness and commits sin is of the devil,^
footnote:[1 John 3:8]
and will inherit the portion of the one by whom he is moved and guided.
For God`'s righteousness will neither mix with nor cover deceit,
nor was it ever given for that purpose; but as it is obeyed,
it reveals and destroys both man`'s righteousness and unrighteousness,
according as it is revealed from faith to faith.
And all who have Christ`'s righteousness will witness its effect, to kill and make alive,
even as it is received by faith.
Yes, this is Zion`'s righteousness "`that goes forth as a brightness,
and its salvation is as a lamp that burns.`"^
footnote:[Isaiah 62:1]

Be ashamed you heathens, who lean upon the Lord, and say,
"`the righteousness of Christ,
the righteousness of Christ;`" for you have more dishonored
His righteousness than any that came before you;
and the name of a Christian has become a reproach in all the world
because of your unfaithfulness to the righteousness of Christ.

=== Concerning the Word

The Word is that which was in the beginning,
and which was the beginning of all visible things.
By it all things were made, and though it is the upholder of all visible things,
and reveals their true ground and use, yet it is invisible in itself,
and no visible thing can reveal it.
And as without it "`nothing was made that was made,`"^
footnote:[John 1:3]
so without it nothing can be seen according as it was made,
nor can anything be used in its pure and proper place; but whatever man meddles with,
not having the Word in him to guide, order, and sanctify, the same he defiles,
and it becomes polluted as to him.
Without this Word no holy Scripture can be read with profit,
for it opens the Scriptures of truth.
And though the Scriptures declare it,
yet neither the Scriptures nor all the writings in the world are able
to comprehend it or declare the depth and extent of it,
which is beyond all descriptions.
Nevertheless,
it is the teacher and guide of those who are the Lord`'s in all generations;
and the saints in all generations have known it in measure, more or less,
though it has no place in the world`'s religious professions.

So hearing of a Word, but not knowing it, men say the written letter is it.
But whoever has this Word has that which comprehends death and hell and the grave,
that which binds and chains Satan, overcomes the world,
issues forth life and light whereby the new
creation is known in which righteousness dwells.
These things are witnessed by those who have the Word abiding in them,
but not by everyone who has the written letter.
The will of man cannot change the Word, for it is contrary to the will of man;
nor can man`'s wit open or expound it,
for it confounds the wisdom of the wise and brings to
naught the understanding of the prudent.
Yes, this Word hides from the wise and prudent, but reveals itself to babes,
and grows and increases within them, which the letter does not do.
And as it grows, it sanctifies all that have it,
and is a fire and a hammer to all who know it.
Indeed, it is quick and powerful, dividing asunder the joints and marrow,
the soul and spirit, wherever it is found; but the letter is not so.
And this Word is a reproach to every carnal mind, even to many who profess the letter.
Whosoever has the Word,
with it they are washed and cleansed and translated from the world, and conformed to God,
so far as they possess it.
But many have the letter who know not God, but are in the unclean customs,
fashions and ways of the world, and are neither changed nor reconciled to Him.

No one can keep both this Word and his sins,
but having only the written letter he may;
for wherever the Word is known the new creature is witnessed,
who is created to walk in righteousness.
And he who has the Word,
sees that all who claim to know the Word but walk not in righteousness,
are liars and do not practice the truth.
These indeed dishonor the Word, and speak as though it could dwell with pollution.
But the Word is a fire to burn up all uncleanness wherever it is found;
so that wherever sin stands, the Word is not known.

Carnal men may read of the Word of the Lord which came to the saints,
in obedience to which the saints were washed, purified, and begotten again.
But not knowing this Word in themselves, these say the Word is the written letter,
which only declares it.
Thus the word that they know has no power in them to
overcome the devil and break the bonds of wickedness;
whereas the Word of God is not bound but free,
and sets free all that obey it and have it abiding in them.
Yes, it breaks down the seat of sin, and raises up and quickens the Seed of God.
Thus, the old life and the Word cannot stand together in one body;
nor can the old man know any word but the letter.
And in his imagination,
he searches with fallen wisdom for that which God (in
His wisdom) has hidden from the wise and learned,
and so remains in darkness.
To this man the Scriptures are as a parable and a mystery,
which his disobedient wisdom cannot find out.
So he brings meanings, interpretations, twistings, and additions,
all of which arise from the man who cannot enter, and in whom the Word does not dwell.

So then, man having gone out into the world,
the light of the gospel is preached in order to turn him again to the Word,
so that coming to the knowledge of this Word in the heart,
and having the mind stayed upon it in the light,
he may come to see the power of the Word working
out the unclean nature and the rebellious will,
slaying the carnal man and all his affections by the cross,
and working in the pure nature.
And so, through the death of the old the new rises up,
making a new creation in Christ Jesus with power
to do good works that come from the eternal Word.
Such good works are accepted by God, for He is their mover and worker,
and the creature is only the servant therein, working together in the same power.
This is not man taking performances upon himself from the written letter,
but is the eternal counsel and strength of God, commanded, moved,
and performed in God`'s will and time, and contrary to the will of the flesh,
whereby the will of all flesh is subdued, so that God`'s own works do praise Him.

So then, because of the living Word, a living soul comes to be witnessed,
the life of Christ is made manifest in the mortal body,
and the creature comes to have fellowship in the life,
being transformed thereinto and united in one.
This is the "`Word of reconciliation,`"^
footnote:[2 Corinthians 5:18]
which unites God and the creature in Spirit.
Whoever knows this, needs not go out looking for wisdom,
counsel or strength against all the powers of darkness or the wiles of the enemy,
but by diligently taking heed to the Word which is near in the heart,
he finds issues of life, spiritual strength, and power against all spiritual wickedness.

=== Concerning Worship

The worship of the true and living God stands outside of man`'s natural will,
knowledge, wisdom and prudence; for God is a Spirit, and in Spirit He is worshipped.
He is not worshipped by men`'s hands or with bodily exercise (except
so far as the eternal Spirit is the author and mover);
nor does His worship stand in food and drink,
nor various washings or other carnal ordinances
taken on by tradition or imitation of others,
but only as every creature is moved by the Spirit of the living God.
God will be served and worshipped in His own Spirit,
and not with anything else that man has offered since the fall.
So the imaginations, thinkings, and conceivings of man are shut out; all of man`'s ways,
man`'s times and forms, customs, orders, and ideas concerning decency,
devised and added by men,
are all shut out and condemned by that Spirit in which God alone is worshipped.
God`'s people are taught His worship and the manner of it;
and the times are in His hand whose worship it is.

Thus, before any can rightly worship God, they must wait to know His Spirit,
who alone leads to true knowledge and worship (both the matter and the manner).
All who desire to worship Him acceptably must know His light,
and in it must wait to know what God calls for at your hands.
For it is not what men appoint for you to do or
not do that will acquit you before the Lord.
For know this: God made man for Himself and for His service,
and the living God is not a dumb idol,
that people should imagine a way to serve Him as may
best suit the fashion and custom of a nation or people.
Rather, He that made man has given him a measure of life from Himself,
to be increased in His service;
and a light also He has given whereby man can see the moving of this Spirit of life.
This life or Spirit always moves according to the will of God, because it is of Him,
and so wherever it moves in the creature it ever draws towards God.
The mind, will, affections, and love of God are in it,
and he who walks in the light sees these things.

But the creature running out before this, or without this,
runs into all manner of dead works and worships;
and the ground of this arises from darkness and disobedience.
For the creature who has been out in the world and its unrighteous ways,
doing what is evil,
is condemned by the light in his heart for evil and for neglecting what is good;
but then the same corrupt mind runs to acts of worship in order to get peace,
so that both his evil deeds and his worship are performed in the same nature.
Thus his prayer becomes an abomination (as was said of others, Prov. 28:9);
for he that regards iniquity in his heart,
God will not hear his prayers nor accept his worship.
Indeed, this is Cain`'s sacrifice, and these are Esau`'s prayers.
But your worship must be performed in the One who never sinned,
or it cannot be accepted by the pure God.

So that the way to be well-pleasing to the Father is
to wait in the light until you feel something of the Spirit of
life (which is in Christ Jesus) moving in you,
and then, joining with that, in its power you may worship.
For this power comes from God, and He cannot forget Himself.
What is done in His light and power and wisdom
and strength is done in the name of Christ;
and whatever is done in His name is not denied by the Father.
So far as any are in Him, that far they are sons, and are accepted in Him,
but without Him you can do nothing, nor be regarded by the Father.
You who know not this power to lead and guide you in your worship,
are "`worshipping what you do not know,`"^
footnote:[John 4:22]
neither do you know with what nature you worship (though you
claim to be about His worship and work).
Alas, false worshippers were always the greatest enemies to Christ and so to their own souls;
and woe to him who thus hides his sin.

So all who desire to worship in truth, you must first know the truth,
even the Spirit of truth who leads into all truth.
This Spirit of truth takes of Christ and testifies of
His life and power in the creature who is worshipping.
These know they are in Him and that He is in them,
and in Him they worship the Father of truth,
so that God is served by what comes from Him.
Only as far as this is known can any worship God in Spirit.

Therefore, you who have received light from Christ, wait in it,
till therein you find the Spirit leading, acting, and ordering;
and here the least worshipper in the light is found in God`'s service,
when you wait upon Him in Spirit.
And such as abide in this light, waiting upon God in the light,
are kept from serving the prince of darkness;
for their loins are girded and their lamps are burning,
and they are always ready to know His voice and answer it with obedience.
But those whose fear and service towards God are
taught by the precepts of men do worship in vain;
for "`all the children of the Lord are taught of the Lord,`"^
footnote:[Isaiah 54:13]
and, "`They are the sons of God who are led by the Spirit of God.`"^
footnote:[Romans 8:13]
These hearken to the Lord and know His voice; and what they see and hear, that they do,
and "`do not offer the sacrifice of fools.`"^
footnote:[Ecclesiastes 5:1]

But do you not offer the sacrifice of fools,
you who are fighting and contending for a manner of worship which Christ never ordained,
nor His followers ever practiced,
which you may clearly see if you but compare your
established worship with the practice of the saints.
For all has been changed by men and councils, under pretense of decency and conformity,
or something else that stands in the will of man, but which God never commanded.
Truly, Nebuchadnezzar was not more zealous for his image than you are for yours,
and if you had his power,
you too would force those who have found the
everlasting way of Christ to bow to your imaginations.
But you will never find God in a worship that does not come from Him,
which men and councils have altered and added to,
and changed from time to time according as it best suits their customs and countries,
so that each nation has its different manner of worship.
And though all be agreed upon by the councils of men,
still it lies out of the counsel of God.

So all who have gone out in any way from Christ the true pattern and example,
have gone into the imaginations of men and into "`will-worship,`"^
footnote:[Colossians 2:23 KJV]
and there have become servants of men, and not of God.
For it is not the name that makes it God`'s worship, but the nature,
which must be in Spirit and in the will of God.
This nature is contrary to the will and wisdom of men,
in which they have performed their idolatrous worship in all ages,
and set up their likenesses and images instead of true worship, being blind of heart,
and assuming that all were out of the right way but themselves.

And truly, this is what you have done,
all you who at this day set up an imitation from the written
letter of what other men have done and experienced,
but have not received your command and power in Spirit from the Lord.
To you it will be said, "`Who has required these things from your hands?`"^
footnote:[Isaiah 1:12]
For all the saints have their command in the Spirit,
and know how the Spirit gives life to fulfill the command,
and so their worship is spiritual, and the heart and mind and soul are united in it.
Here there is no idol or likeness, but in one Spirit is found the command, the power,
the life, the will, the way, and the worship.
But all you who have sought to take on the saints`' practices without being called,
commanded and furnished in Spirit, you lack power and life,
and so even in the time of your worship your hearts run out after carnal things.
This is spiritual idolatry, for whatever your minds are in,
that is the god which you worship.
But the pure God seeks truth in the inward parts.

=== Concerning Faith

He that has the living faith (which is in Christ) _lives_ by it;
and the life that he lives is above all the world and the powers of darkness.
The least measure of this faith is perfect,
and is a present power against all the assaults
of Satan if the creature abides faithful in it,
and does not run to other helps, and so expose himself to distrust.
For true faith is the gift of God, and whosoever receives a measure of it,
has a measure of the Son,
against which the Father will not allow any temptation to prevail.
This faith lays hold upon God`'s righteousness,
which righteousness is seen in the light and wrought in the Spirit,
whereby the creature becomes "`God`'s workmanship,
created in Christ Jesus unto good works,`"^
footnote:[Ephesians 2:10]
and so becomes free from evil, dead to sin, but alive to God`'s righteousness,
waiting in faith to see righteousness revealed through obedience thereto,
from faith to faith, as it is written, "`The just shall live by faith.`"^
footnote:[Habakkuk 2:4; Romans 1:17; Galatians 3:11; Hebrews 10:38]

Now this is the living faith, which "`purifies the heart`"^
footnote:[Acts 15:9]
unto a life of godliness,
and so reveals the righteousness of faith for an inheritance--everlasting righteousness,
ever growing and springing--whereby the creature grows into the knowledge of God,
and walks with Him by faith, out of the world with its pleasures and kingdoms,
into the kingdom of the Son of God.
Here the reproach of Christ is esteemed great riches,
and men lay hold of invisible things--things which the world`'s faith cannot reach.
For man`'s faith carries him no higher than visible reasoning
and consulting with sensual wisdom and carnal help,
and so brings nothing to perfection, because it sees not Him who is perfect.
But the living faith sees Him who is invisible,
and lays hold of the measure of God made manifest in Spirit, which works out the old,
and works what is new (both the will and the deed),
whose work is perfect both to kill and to make alive.

But the world`'s faith is not of this nature and power,
for they hear a thing with the outward ear, and so set themselves to believe,
or not to believe, according to their own will or imagination,
or from outward persuasion.
And as their imaginations, thoughts, and conceivings change, so their faith changes also;
and thus it cannot be steadfast,
because it does not stand in the measure of God`'s Spirit known in the heart.
This faith does not serve God, nor can it please Him,
nor does it "`see Him that is invisible.`"^
footnote:[Hebrews 11:27]
And so,
not standing in that power which is contrary to the will of man and the power of sin,
the world`'s faith lies subject to the will of men,
and the power of the prince of this world; and as the world and the times change,
so does the faith, but it can never lead out of the world, and out of time,
up to the Redeemer of the soul.
And to all who remain in this nature,
the living faith (which comes from God and stands in a pure conscience) is a mystery,
neither known nor received.

So then, the faith of Christ and the faith of the world are distinct,
and have their different effects and fruits.
The one professes freedom and redemption in the imagination and comprehension,
but remains a servant of sin;
the other has the living faith which gives the life of freedom.
And as their ground and root is different, so is their fruit and effect,
the one being always against the other.
For that faith which stands in Christ slays sin, and believes in purity, perfection,
and holiness, and it is by this faith alone that the just shall live,
bringing justice and righteousness to light in godly conduct.
But the faith which stands in the imaginations and wisdom of man,
which believes in salvation without holiness of life, this faith crucifies the Just One,
and keeps the unjust alive.
Indeed,
this is the faith of those who believed the Scriptures and the words of the prophets,
and that God was their Father, but not having the Word of faith in their hearts,
slew the Son of God and set the murderer free.

So then, even as the faith which is dead works death,
so the faith which is living works life.
For a profession of faith without righteousness is like a body without life;
and as a living man is known by his actions, so the living faith is known by its fruits.
Just as man cannot live without action,
so true faith in Christ cannot be without righteousness.
These are inseparable, therefore it is called "`the righteousness of faith;`"^
footnote:[Romans 4:11,13; 9:30; 10:6]
where "`the heart believes unto righteousness, there the mouth confesses to salvation,`"^
footnote:[Romans 10:10]
without hypocrisy or self-righteousness.
Therefore, God`'s righteousness is received in the heart by faith,
and by obedience thereto it is brought forth into the
world as a witness against all unrighteousness.
But it is a dead faith that does not bring forth the life of Christ into the world.

=== Concerning Hope

Hope is a gift of God.
It is pure, and stands in that which is pure,
showing the soul the purity of God and the righteousness in Christ Jesus.
Beholding this,
the soul is kept from joining to the wicked one in all of his temptations,
because it sees in the light a better expectation.
For when the life of Christ is not known in full power, yet it is beheld in the hope,
which is as an anchor to stay the mind from following the unclean one;
so that hope keeps out of sin, and "`makes not ashamed,`"^
footnote:[Romans 5:5]
and even in the hour of distress it "`hopes against hope.`"^
footnote:[Romans 4:18]
This is the hope that enters within the veil into the holy place,
where life and immortality are brought to light,
which no mortal eye or carnal sense can approach.
Yes, this is the living hope,
which hopes to the end that Christ and His
righteousness may be revealed to take away sin,
and to save from it, and out of it.
And in the hope of this, the children of God wait in the obedience of the Spirit,
not conforming themselves to deceitful lusts;
but as He who has called them to hope is holy, so "`he that has this hope in him,
purifies himself even as He is pure.`"^
footnote:[1 John 3:3]

But the devil has begotten another sort of hope in his servants,
who believe him and are acted upon by his spirit.
This hope stands on another ground and brings forth another fruit,
telling a man that though he be a servant of sin, yet there is hope of salvation.
And though the witness of God in the conscience testifies to the contrary,
yet the serpent teaches that this hope must not be judged false or questioned.
So that where the devil has become the teacher in man,
a tender conscience is resisted as the greatest error and foolishness in the world.
And by him man is taught that to wait for a Christ
within is to deny the Christ who died at Jerusalem;
or that to seek the mystery that has been hidden from ages (namely,
Christ within the hope of glory),
is to deny the person of Christ and His blood and sufferings.
And many such imaginations has Satan begotten in people`'s
minds to scare them from minding the light of Christ within,
that so he may keep the heart in darkness, and his seat there undiscovered.

So he sets men to look for an outward kingdom of Christ,
and for an outward manifestation of the Spirit, and an outward light, an outward Word,
and an outward righteousness,
and to hope in these even while the serpent dwells in the heart,
and there (in darkness) upholds his kingdom of
sin and a seat of unrighteousness all their life,
feeding them with a hope of what they will experience after they are dead,
by a profession of words without the power and life and Spirit and truth in them.
This is "`the hope of the hypocrite that must perish`"^
footnote:[Job 8:13]
in the end and come short of salvation.

For it is not the hope of Christ to live in sin and yet hope for salvation.
No, Christ`'s hope longs for freedom from sin as much as freedom from hell.
And he who knows Christ and hopes in Him, hopes in righteousness,
and desires as much to live in righteousness in the present
evil world as to stand in righteousness in the day of judgment.
But is there any reason why you should hope to be saved by Christ,
who presently will to be the devil`'s servants, and yield your members as servants to him,
delighting in his wickedness while you live,
and yet desiring to be saved by Christ`'s righteousness when you die?

=== Concerning Love

The love of God is pure and perfect, and cannot stand together with self,
or with any changeable thing.
God is love, and none can dwell in love except they dwell in God.
And as the creature comes to live in God, he is changed into His image and likeness,
and so God`'s love is seen in pure light and shed abroad in the heart,
whereby the power of faith works to the overcoming of all that is contrary to Him.
Here the love of God abounds, and those who dwell in it work no evil,
but through the work of love fulfill the law of God.
But the world`'s love arises from the spirit of the world,
which (for selfish ends) sets the affections on changeable things,
and so goes out into enmity against God.
Thus it is that "`whosoever will be a friend of
the world makes himself an enemy of God.`"^
footnote:[James 4:4]
But the love of God is a fruit of God`'s Spirit,
which springs from the fountain and runs out to the whole creation of God.
None have this love but those who have the Spirit from which it springs,
which is eternal, unchangeable, and above all carnal things,
nor can time or carnal things quench it.

God so loved the world that He gave His Son into the
world as a light to condemn sin in the flesh,
so that the righteousness of God might be fulfilled in the creature,
in walking after the Spirit and denying the works of the flesh.
And truly, this is the love of God to sinners:
to condemn all sin and to take it away by the light and life of Jesus Christ.
All who love with this love know that this is its aim and end.
But with the love of God all man`'s love is condemned,
which stands in things that have come in through the fall,
and have defiled both body and soul.

So then, this love of God consists of reproofs,
judgment and condemnation against all that defiles the creation,
and against the creature who yields to pollution.
This is pure love to the soul,
for it deals faithfully therewith in declaring its condition.
And this was the great love which Christ showed the Jews,
when he told them they were hypocrites, blind guides, liars, saying, "`Woe to you,
you serpents, you generation of vipers, how can you escape the damnation of hell?`"^
footnote:[Matthew 23:33]
Many such plain and true words He spoke in love to them.
So too it was the love of God in Paul which said to Elymas,
"`O full of all deceit and all fraud, you son of the devil,
you enemy of all righteousness,
will you not cease perverting the straight ways of the Lord?`"^
footnote:[Acts 13:10]
For all the love that can be shown to any creature is to deal faithfully and
truly with them according as they are seen in the light;
and he who does not love both God and man in this way (as will
be seen in the day of judgment) are out of God`'s love,
and have imagined a love which is of another nature.
These flatter one another in their evil ways and changeable opinions,
and their love is grounded in carnal things and stands in their own wills.
So they love when they will, and they hate when they will,
but they know not love as it is in God, nor do they hate what God hates.
And such is their blindness who say,
"`All must be won by love,`" that they know not what they affirm.
For God says, "`I will redeem Zion with judgment,`"^
footnote:[Isaiah 1:27]
and "`with the spirit of judgment and burning will I wash away her filth.`"^
footnote:[Isaiah 4:4]
But those who are still in their filth would have all others flattered therein.

So then, the love that spares filthiness is filthy,
for it defiles the temple of God.
But the love of the Spirit is pure,
for it condemns the unclean and purges away the filth of all who love it.
But woe to that love which gains friends by sparing God`'s enemies.
Therefore Paul says, "`Let love be without hypocrisy.
Abhor what is evil.
Cling to what is good.`"^
footnote:[Romans 12.9]
This is the love that uncovers sin, condemns sin to death,
and covers it with righteousness.
So James says,
"`He who turns a sinner from the error of his way will
save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins.`"^
footnote:[James 5:20]
And Solomon says, "`Open rebuke is better than love carefully concealed;`"^
footnote:[Proverbs 27:5]
for such wounds are precious to all who know what love is.
But he that spares a man`'s wickedness, hates God`'s righteousness.
And so, with the light, God`'s love and the devil`'s love are seen,
and how each loves his own works, and so do their children in whom they reign.
And whoever loves the one, hates the other; and he that serves the one,
despises the other; and so the servant always contends for the master whom he loves.

=== Concerning Judgment

True judgment (as it is made known to men) is a gift from the Spirit of God,
set in the heart of everyone who dwells in the light of Christ,
which judgment passes upon all in the creature that is contrary to the life of God.
And as it is received, it springs up with light and salvation,
to the redeeming of the heart from all uncleanness,
condemning all that is contrary to purity,
that God may be seen in His dwelling place with His righteousness.
Thus He is said to "`redeem Zion with judgment, and her converts with righteousness;`"^
footnote:[Isaiah 1:27]
and to "`purge away the filth of the daughter of Zion
with the Spirit of judgment and the Spirit of burning.`"
footnote:[Isaiah 4:4]
And if there be a continual dwelling in the light,
then this judgment ceases not till the throne of
Christ is established in the heart in peace;
for this is His judgment, and it is upon all that stands against His kingdom.
And though the enemies of righteousness love it not,
yet the righteous delight in and love the judgment of God,
for by it they are redeemed and saved,
and know it to be the first promise of God to be received.
For the Lord says, "`I will make My judgment rest as a light of the peoples;`"^
footnote:[Isaiah 51:4]
and when it is received, "`His righteousness is near`"^
footnote:[Isaiah 51:5]
to be revealed.

Therefore His judgment must first pass upon all that is unrighteous,
and none can have Christ`'s righteousness but those who receive His judgment.
For this reason the Lord says, "`I have hewn them by the prophets,
I have slain them by the words of My mouth;
and My judgments are like light that goes forth.`"^
footnote:[Hosea 6:5]
And for this end "`judgment is given to the saints of the Most High.`"^
footnote:[Daniel 7:22]
Ezekiel was often commanded to judge the people and cause them to know their abominations.
And Jeremiah was full of the fury of the Lord, and was weary with holding it in.
And Micah was full of power, by the Spirit of the Lord and of judgment,
to declare to Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sin.
And so in all ages the Lord has placed His judgments in His servants,
and by it they have judged the heathen and those who know not God.
And as many as believed and received God`'s judgments and repented, these found mercy,
but the rest were hardened.

Now this judgment is eternal,
and stands firm in heaven as it is passed upon the earth.
And this was committed to the apostles as a doctrine--that whoever they bound,
were bound; and whoever they loosed, were loosed.
Therefore did all the saints love judgment;
for they knew it to be the ministration of Christ
ministered out upon all that is against Christ,
and whatever is against Christ is against the soul.
So this "`judgment must begin at the house of God;`"^
footnote:[1 Peter 4:7]
but where the devil keeps the house, there he rejects it.
For Solomon says, "`The ungodly scorn judgment,`"^
footnote:[Proverbs 19:28]
and evil men do not understand it.
For he that will not receive judgment is blind, and does not see that his enemy reigns,
and will continue to reign until "`judgment is brought into victory`"^
footnote:[Matthew 12:20 KJV]
and set up in the earth.
For it is only when "`judgment is laid to the line and righteousness to the plummet`"^
footnote:[Isaiah 28:17]
that the covenant with hell and death is annulled.

But you who hate reproof,
when you are told of your evil hearts (where sin abides), and of your crooked nature,
you say, "`Who made you a judge?`"
And so you seek to stop the ministry of Christ.
But he who has the Spirit of Christ has the Spirit of judgment,
and whoever serves that Spirit must allow it to speak and judge in them.
Therefore David said, "`The tongue of the righteous talks of judgment.
The law of God is in his heart, his steps shall not slide;
but the wicked watches the righteous and seeks to slay him.`"^
footnote:[Ps. 37:30]

=== Concerning Perfection

God is perfect, and so are all His works and all His gifts.
Whoever receives His gifts, receives what is perfect,
and by receiving and joining to that which is perfect,
the creature is gradually made perfect himself.^
footnote:[Early Quakers are sometimes known for their teaching that
believers can become perfect even on this side of the grave.
The word _perfect_ is one that can invite a lot of misinterpretation and imagination,
and so it is important to understand exactly what they believed in this regard.
First of all, this is not an improvement or a perfection of the sinful,
fleshly nature of man.
This nature is not improved or repaired;
it is experientially crucified through the inward cross (the power of God),
so that the soul becomes progressively free from the law of sin and death,
and governed by the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.
Therefore, the progress and perfection of the soul arises from the
birth and growth of the Seed of Christ within,
and its victory (by degrees) over the body of death.
Early Friends believed (and many experienced) that the heart could be
united and subjected to the living Truth in such a way so as not to
obey the suggestions and temptations of the evil one,
to cease from actual sinning, and in this sense be perfect.
However, they were always very careful to insist on the following two points:
1) that this kind of perfection always allows for continued spiritual growth.
As Christ Himself is boundless and eternal,
so our growth in Him knows no limits or restrictions.
And 2) that there always remains the possibility of sinning wherever the
heart and mind does not diligently look to and depend upon the Lord.]
No further than a soul abides in this perfection, can it be united to God,
or appear in His sight, or be blessed by Him;
for going out from perfection he goes into the fall and into the curse.
Man has no more of Christ, than what he has of perfection; for perfection is of Christ,
and imperfection and sin are of the devil.
These are two contraries, and come from contrary grounds, and bring forth contrary fruits.
He that is of God is of perfection and believes in perfection;
but he who is of the serpent cannot acknowledge or believe it,
being blinded by the god of this world.

God sent his Son into the world to preach perfection,
even a return to the perfect image of the Father, saying, "`Be perfect,
just as your Father in heaven is perfect.`"^
footnote:[Matthew 5:48]
And when He had left an example of perfection in all things,
He ascended and gave gifts to men "`for the perfecting of the saints,`"^
footnote:[Ephesians 4:12]
that all might come up to the unity of the faith,
"`to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.`"^
footnote:[Ephesians 4:13]
Thus He is an everlasting Redeemer,
perfecting the work of God in every generation
of those that believe in His work and follow Him.
And all His true ministers have sought the same end,
and have preached and prayed that
"`they might present every man perfect in Christ Jesus,`"^
footnote:[Colossians 1:28]
from whom they had received the gift.
And all who believed His ministers, believed in perfection,
and pressed after it as the end of their faith;
knowing that nothing less than perfection could give them perfect rest and redemption.

Now, since the mystery of iniquity has entered,
another sort of ministry has gone forth into the world,
which has taken up an imitation instead of a gift,
and has begotten another kind of faith that is wholly opposed to perfection,
preaching against it, holding it as blasphemy,
and calling it a doctrine of devils and the like.
These desire to be called the ministers of Christ,
though they deceive all who receive their words.
And any who look to the end of their work,
may easily see as much difference as between Christ and Belial.
For the work of Christ is (and ever has been) to renew man again to a perfect state;
and the work of antichrist is to withstand this;
and each has his ministers suitable to their intended ends.
Christ`'s end is to perfect, the devil`'s is to keep in sin,
and each sort of ministers have their corresponding faith, hope, and gifts--the one pure,
and the other polluted.
According to each sort of faith, so are they who believe and follow.
The faith of Christ is a shield, and gives victory over uncleanness, sin, and evil.
But the devil`'s faith lets sin in, and believes it must be so.
And had not the devil first brought man to believe him rather than God,
he could never have polluted what God had perfected.
But the way he first wrought upon man is the same way he keeps up his work.

So then, none come to know the new creature but those who
believe in perfection in Christ.
For all who are in the imperfect and polluted
righteousness are in their own righteousness;
but the least measure of God`'s righteousness is perfect,
and those who become servants of it are thereby made free from sin.
So it is by your unbelief that you destroy your souls, and remain in your own works,
which make nothing perfect.
And then measuring yourselves with yourselves, you cut yourselves off from Christ.
And measuring your faith by your own ability,
you stand in that covenant which makes nothing perfect.
But for this cause the first covenant was found faulty and annulled,
because "`it made not those who performed the
service perfect in regard to the conscience.`"^
footnote:[Hebrews 9:9]

=== Concerning Obedience

Spiritual and living obedience is not that obedience of man`'s way and will,
wherein men and women (in the first birth and wisdom) read the Scriptures,
find what the saints performed in the Spirit and power of the Lord Jesus,
and then set themselves to do the like.
This is to make an imitation instead of to obey,
to set up self-works instead of Christ`'s works,
to obey self-righteousness instead of God`'s righteousness,
and so to cover themselves with filthy rags instead of everlasting righteousness.
All who will know true obedience must first know a
measure of God`'s Spirit in the light of Jesus Christ.
Herein they will find movings and drawings towards Christ,
and a faith that lays hold upon God`'s righteousness,
and an obedience that is in Christ Jesus, the second Adam.
And as the creature joins in the light to the Spirit of Christ,
and believes in the life of Jesus made manifest, he is quickened unto the one obedience,
which is contrary to the will of man.
For there is but one true obedience which is in Christ Jesus,
which He learned of the Father for us,
that in this obedience many may be made righteous.^
footnote:[Romans 5:19]
And all who learn Christ, learn His obedience,
which was not what He saw or heard from men, but what He saw and heard of the Father;
not in His own time or will, but in the Father`'s,
nor did He do anything of His own accord, but only what he saw the Father do.
In this obedience Christ was always found;
not doing what the scribes and Pharisees did (though they sat in Moses`' seat),
nor what the world approved, but what was contrary to the world,
and contrary to His own will;
always and only submitting to the moving of the Spirit of the Father that dwelt in Him,
by which alone He was guided and furnished for every good work.

And now all that believe in Him and follow His light,
He leads them by degrees into the same knowledge and obedience,
out of all carnal knowledge, power, and obedience;
so that by faith the creature is made partaker of Christ`'s
obedience and the power thereof from faith to faith.
And all who have learned Him find that "`as He is, so are they in this present world,`"^
footnote:[1 John 4:17]
both in love and in life, in power and in Spirit,
according to the measure that Christ is learned.
And this is not an obedience from without, but an obedience to the truth,
through the Spirit, which is in life and not in imitation,
in the will of God and not in self-will.
It does not stand in things seen by men, or done by men,
by which men may imitate or do the like.
Rather, it stands in Jesus Christ and in His own obedience to the Father,
seen in the light by the measure of faith received,
whereby the believer is made one in it, and it in him.
Thus, as the same Father still calls for the same obedience in Spirit,
so the believer now offers himself up, with all that he has,
in the same Spirit and power and obedience which are in Christ Jesus.
And so as the creature by faith partakes of that one obedience, in the second Adam,
he is made righteous, and no further;
even as all are made sinners as they partake of the disobedience of the first Adam,
and no further.

Therefore, whoever knows how to partake of this obedience,
also knows the eternal Spirit in which all the children of God have
been taught and enabled to obey (in their various measures),
ever since the world began.
And this obedience is not works done by them,
but the everlasting righteousness of God obeyed in the Spirit,
according to its own motions which are seen in the light of Christ.
But none who are heart-blind can know this,
who mind the motions of the flesh and obey them;
for their minds have gone out into carnal pleasures,
and the call to Christ`'s obedience is not heard by them.
Nevertheless the carnal spirit that leads out into the world
teaches men to make an imitation of this obedience,
and so deceives the simple by setting up a likeness without life,
and glorying in appearance but not in heart.
And then,
as the Witness of God in the heart or conscience testifies to
such as these that their obedience is not perfect or accepted,
they conclude that there can be no perfect obedience attained in this world;
for they know not the powerful working of God`'s Spirit that
perfectly works in those who believe and walk in the light,
whereby they become His workmanship in Christ Jesus.
These are brought into His obedience,
and His obedience is wrought in them (in their measure), till they become of one heart,
one mind, one soul, one Spirit, one flesh and bone and blood, one obedience,
and one life, so that it is no more we who live, but Christ that lives in us;
and the life that we now live is by faith in the Son of God.
And though the fullness of this obedience is not attained at once,
yet the least measure of it is perfect and accepted;
for it is accepted in Him in whom it is wrought.
And as the obedience of a child is as pure and willing as the obedience of a strong man,
so it is with the babe in Christ Jesus, according to what the Father requires,
who never requires anything but what He gives,
and never gives anything but what is perfect and what He perfectly accepts.

=== Concerning Good Works

As there is but one true good,
so there is but one true worker of good in heaven and in earth,
who by the Word of His power made all things good in the beginning.
By this good work and good will man was made in the image of God,
and so stood in His goodness.
But falling from that steadfastness which is in God,
and looking to self to make himself wise, he became subtle and proud,
and seeking to be like God, was cast out from God, from His power, love,
and goodness, into the dark imagination of his own fallen heart.
Thus finding himself under the curse (of which the light of
Christ in the conscience bears witness) he quickly set himself
to make likenesses of God and His worship,
and of good works, of faith, hope, patience, love, etc.
But being under the powers of darkness, and knowing neither God nor His work,
he is deceived by the prince of darkness and pleases
himself with an imitation of God`'s works (without power)
and so he imagines he does good.
But the testimony of God in his heart bears witness
against him that his work is not perfect or accepted.
He also imagines that he is redeemed,
though he is still under the commanding power of Satan, led captive at his will.
And in order to more strongly bind him,
Satan leads him into an appearance of worship so that man will not suspect his slavery,
nor be too much troubled at his other unrighteous practices.
Thus it is that even the worst of men in this state have their worship,
and each sort thinks they are right, and are not as bad as others,
for they have their form of religion and their pretended good works,
though they have gone far out from the one good work of God.

And it is no small work to undeceive even the least of these,
though men of greater wits and learning may
easily lead them from one deception to another.
But all the world`'s wisdom cannot bring them into the one good work of God,
nor teach them the way whereby it is wrought.
Only those who mind the light of Christ in their dark
hearts (which manifests evils and reproves them for it),
who take heed to follow it out of the world and all carnal mindedness,
and who wait in the light until the living Word is received in their hearts--only these,
I say, come into the true good work and will of God.
For without the Word nothing was made, and without it nothing can be redeemed.
For it is the Word of the Lord, heard and received,
that quickens the dead and raises to life that which is dead in trespasses and sins.
And it is the power of this same Word that brings forth
the work of God`'s righteousness in the spiritual man.
Thus the creature is renewed in the spirit of his mind and
receives wisdom and power to escape evil and resist it,
and to bring to light all that God begets in the heart.

And as the believer diligently continues waiting in the light,
and is obedient to this work in the Spirit,
so he comes still more and more to learn God`'s power and teaching,
as well as Christ`'s obedience.
And so the wisdom and care of God are over him,
leading him into sufferings and tribulations, trials and temptations,
and the faith and fellowship with Christ therein.
And if the creature stands firm, not a hair of his head can fall to the ground,
but he is sure to come out more pure than gold.
So he grows in the knowledge of Christ and His sonship,
toward the measure and stature and fullness of the perfect man, into the likeness of God.
It is in this way that all the saints were made conformable to God by His mighty working,
whereby He wrought powerfully in them according to His good pleasure,
and contrary to their fleshly pleasures.
And what is wrought in this way is good, because it comes from the fountain of all good.

Now, this is not a new work, but the everlasting good work of God,
manifest to the creature, and through the creature to the world.
And by it God is glorified,
who is its Father and author and finisher in everyone that truly believes.
This is no self-work,
nor can it be wrought in any except where self
is denied and where a cross to self is taken up.
So all boasting is excluded, for the creature has nothing but what he has received,
and not by his own will or deed, but by believing in the light,
and through the obedience of faith.
And though there may be a variety of works,
according to the soul`'s obedience and measure,
yet all bring about the one work of the creature`'s redemption, and God`'s praise therein.

The world is ignorant of the true work of God, though they are preaching,
pressing, and performing their good works (as they call them);
but all their works do not manifest the power that brings out of sin and the world,
and conformity to its ways and worship.
But the good work of God in His saints (as they become obedient to His
working and subject to His will) always begets the creature nearer to God,
and into His likeness and nature,
until they suffer all manner of evil for the name of God that is in them,
and are hated by the world.
Yet the reproach of the world becomes great riches to
all who love God and are obedient to His work.

So then, self-works and God`'s works are made manifest in the light.
The one is that which men see, hear, or imagine,
and so set themselves to imitate in their own wills and ways,
according to what they have conceived in their fallen wisdom and earthly minds,
not in the Spirit, but in the oldness of the letter or the traditions of men.
But everyone who will come into the work of God will be
taught to deny the world and their own wills,
so that all that is within them may bow and
conform to the motion and workings of the Spirit,
which are seen by all who dwell in the light.
These, in the way and time of the Spirit,
bring forth the fruits of the Spirit in the sight of God.

=== Concerning Election and Reprobation

This is a doctrine which is sealed from the world;
nor can any truly know it or receive it who are still in the reprobate state.
And though many are disputing about it in the dark,
none truly know it but the children of light.
For there is a spirit who would foolishly charge God with having determined
the condemnation of many persons before they even come into the world;
and though they seek after God, yet they cannot be saved,
because God has purposed the contrary.
In the same way, these say that some are concluded unto salvation,
though they live and die in their sins.
Truly, this doctrine is of the spirit of the world,
which knows not the secrets of God revealed in the Spirit,
and therefore judges carnally from the letter and from figures and shadows.
And those who are of this spirit know not the truth which lies in a mystery;
and being without light, they can only imagine.
For no one knows the purpose of God but he who comes back to the beginning;
for in the beginning the election and reprobation were established by an eternal
and unalterable decree __in the two seeds__--the seed according to the flesh,
and the seed according to the Spirit.
And he who can judge concerning these two seeds,
can also understand the two vessels ordained, one to honor and the other to dishonor;
and as every man is found in one of these, so is God`'s purpose with respect to him.

Now in the fall, all are in the dishonor, and so are children of wrath,
under the curse, and so without God and without the promise;
and not having God dwelling in them, they are no vessels of honor,
but are reprobate concerning Him.
But in Christ Jesus the election is known,
for He is the elect Seed in whom the election is obtained and established.
And in the midst of all darkness His light is offered to lead men out of the dishonor,
out of the curse and the fall;
and whosoever believes in His light (without respect of persons),
He leads out of the world, to the cleansing and purging of the body, soul, and mind,
till the vessel is changed from the oldness of the will, affections,
and lusts of the flesh, to the newness of the Spirit.
Thus, in heart and mind the creature is brought out of
the flesh (which is prepared for dishonor,
and where the dishonor lodges) and is brought to live in the Spirit,
where the lusts of the flesh are not fulfilled,
and so the vessel of honor is witnessed which is prepared for the Master`'s use.
But while men remain in the flesh,
they are prepared for dishonor and fitted for destruction,
not knowing the Master nor their proper use.
And though God endures such vessels with much long-suffering,
who will not acknowledge the mercy shown to them in His Son,
He may at His pleasure display His wrath upon them.
And for this same purpose He long endured Pharaoh, and allowed his oppression,
till He saw fit to show His power upon him who had long
been raising himself above the seed of God.
In the same way He endured the Amorites,
"`until their iniquities were full;`"^
footnote:[Genesis 15:16]
and so He does with many at this day,
who proceed from one wickedness to another until they fill up their measure,
that He may make known His wrath upon those that will not acknowledge His Seed.

So shall it be with all who will not acknowledge the light of Christ,
whose day of visitation has past.
Such have a measure of sin to fill up in the other seed, which they shall not pass by.
And for this purpose that evil seed was raised up and prepared,
that God may show His power upon all who "`do
not like to retain God in their knowledge,`"^
footnote:[Romans 1:28]
that they all might be condemned who take pleasure in unrighteousness,
serving the creature more than the Creator,
whose hearts are filled with all immorality and fleshly lusts.
These are indeed the vessels of dishonor.
Yet "`if a man purge himself from these things, he shall be a vessel unto honor,
sanctified, and fit for the master`'s use, and prepared unto every good work.`"^
footnote:[2 Timothy 2:21]
But those who live in these things are indeed reprobate with respect to God and His work.

So then, here is the election and reprobation: those who are after the Spirit,
and those who are after the flesh.
Those who are after the flesh are not the seed;
but those who live by the Spirit are accounted for the Seed.
These have obtained the promise, but the rest are hardened.
And so there is no unrighteousness with God,
but the unrighteousness is with men who reject the counsel of the Lord
against themselves and choose to abide in that which God has cursed.
And here, all that continue will be hardened to their own destruction,
notwithstanding all their endeavors and labors,
prayers and tears that are in this nature; for these are not accepted,
being of that seed which is enmity against the Seed of God.
Against this seed God has decreed His displeasure,
but in the other He has established His mercy forever.
Therefore, "`it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs,
but of God that shows mercy.`"^
footnote:[Romans 9:16]
And this mercy He has set above all His works,
so that he who stays in the world cannot obtain it.
But the light which leads out of the world leads up to it, and whosoever comes unto Him,
He will in no way cast off.
But he who does not come to Him is cast off already,
because he will not come to the light of life.

So now hearken, all you vain babblers,
who spend your time disputing about election with your reprobate minds.
When you find that the light of Christ condemns you for your lusts and earthly delights,
and the Spirit of God moves in you against your evil deeds, but you will not be obedient,
and still harden your hearts against the light--know then,
that _this_ is the reprobate state.
And know also that it is the Spirit of God that strives in you against it,
who does not desire that you die in it.
And let that measure of light in your conscience
judge if your destruction be not of yourself,
you whose way is reprobate from God.
And let it also be a witness against you that God delights not in your destruction,
but rather that you should turn and be saved,
and for this end He has given you His light to reprove you and to lead you to repentance,
showing that He has not determined your condemnation before you were born.
And let the same light which checks you for your sin,
and lets you see in your heart that the righteous God has appointed a
day wherein all shall receive according to their doings,
let it, I say,
be a witness against the vain idea that God has
concluded beforehand to leave you in your wickedness.

So then, the righteous Judge of all the earth will go on doing righteousness.
And to make way for the same,
He has placed His pure light in the heart of everyone that will mind it,
which will clearly show all whether they be in
the elect Seed or in the seed of evildoers;
for it is this light, being believed and followed,
that does reveal the mystery of election and reprobation.
And without this light none can know who is elected or reprobated,
nor can they judge of this matter.

=== Concerning the New Birth

There is an old man, and a new man, which are known in the light, with births,
natures, and kindreds that differ according to that of which they are born.
That which is of the earth is earthly, fleshly, carnal, and corrupt;
and this is the state of the old man.
All that are in this state are fallen from God and His covenant, and are in the curse,
wholly blind in heart with regard to the mysteries of God.
And though in the sensual wisdom of the flesh they make profession of God and His gospel,
they neither know Him nor His power,
but are alienated from His life and led captive in the
dark at the will of him who is the prince of darkness.
Whatever a man does in this state is cursed.
In this state Cain offered his sacrifice but could not be accepted,
for he was out of the state of well-doing or well-being,
though he anxiously desired acceptance.
In this state Esau sought the blessing and wept for it, but could not obtain it.
And in this state Nicodemus came to Christ,
and though he loved Him and believed Him to be sent of God,
could not enter the kingdom in that state, nor know the new birth.
And this is the state which David speaks of, when he says,
"`If I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear me.`"^
footnote:[Psalms 66:18]
And in this state are all who now worship in the flesh,
and in their carnal minds and the sensual wisdom.

But that which is born of heaven is heavenly, spiritual, eternal,
and incorruptible; and this is the state of the new man,
which is begotten of the divine nature of God.
And as is his nature, so are his works, and his delights are spiritual.
For indeed, as is the tree, so are its fruits; and as is the man, so are his works.
So he that is born of this Seed is born of God;
and "`Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in Him.`"^
footnote:[1 John 3:9]
And all who remain in this Seed, and it in them,
have the promise and power that puts off the old man with his deeds, lusts,
and affections; thus the body of sin is put off through the power of the body of Christ,
and redemption is witnessed.
And as the creature passes from the old to the new, so they pass from death to life;
for life is in the new, and there the victory is received over sin, the grave, and hell.
Now the first birth talks of these things in the fallen nature,
but cannot receive the power and victory by which to enter the kingdom,
nor see its glory, and so these take up their rest and delight in visible things,
and so entangle themselves in things whose end is destruction.
But those who are born of the Spirit tread upon such things,
and cannot set their minds upon, nor bow unto, nor be conformable to such vanities.
And so those who are heavenly have no communion with the earthly,
their minds being contrary to each other in all things.
For that which is wisdom to the one is foolishness to the other,
and so it has always been.

Now, the Seed which is of God leads the heart up to God,
but the seed which is of the earth leads into earthly things.
Those who are the children of God are led by His Spirit (of which they are born),
but the children of this world are led by the spirit of this world,
and are captivated in the ways, fashions, and love of the world,
wherein the serpent has his seat and kingdom,
and wherein his power is seen in all who are disobedient to the light of Christ.
And so,
in those who have given up to his power (because of the blindness of their hearts),
he brings forth his enmity against the children of God born after the Spirit,
children of the light and of the immortal Seed, who bear the image of the invisible God,
and worship in the Spirit, being led and guided by that Spirit of which they are born.

Now those who are born of the Spirit can stay no
longer in any form of worship than God stays,
but by His Spirit are led to follow Him wherever He goes, and out of whatever He departs.
But those who are born after the flesh, see only the outside and the form,^
footnote:[With the word _form,_ Nayler is referring to any outward practice, formality,
tradition, manner or method of performing religious service or worship.]
and so abide in the form long after God has departed.
These then become the seat of Satan,
where he sits and persecutes those who follow the Spirit.
In this way the serpent has often beguiled the creature,
by getting into something of the form that was
once used by the saints (while God dwelt therein)
and to this he adds inventions of his own, calling them decency and order and the like.
With this he has deceived the creature so as to serve his ends,
even to shed the blood of their brethren under a pretense of error and blasphemy,
and denying ordinances and forms of worship,
and as being leaders of dangerous sects and heresies, etc.
Thus the children of light have ever been numbered amongst transgressors,
but were never truly so,
except that they transgressed the wills of men to observe the will of God.
Yet all of these suffered as evil-doers in the account of the world,
as not worthy to live in the world, for they were born of a Seed that is above the world,
which the natural man does not know.
So then, "`He that is born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit,
even so it is now,`"^
footnote:[Galatians 4:29]
and these think they do service to God, because they know not the Father nor the Son,
but live in darkness, not acknowledging that Seed whereof the children of light are born.

=== Concerning the Baptism of Christ

In the world there are many sorts and forms of baptisms,
but in Christ there is but one, which is that of the Spirit.
This is Christ`'s baptism, and all who are baptized with it are baptized into His death,
buried with Him to the world, to its ways and worships, loves and friendships,
and to all that is in man that would conform or bow thereto.
And it is through this baptism into death that
the Seed of God is raised up out of the grave,
quickened by the same Spirit which raised Jesus from the dead.
And all that are baptized with this Spirit (knowing the old man to be dead and buried),
are raised a spiritual seed unto God, holy and zealous for good works,
being begotten again of another nature from above, which is but one.
And as they are baptized into this, all grow into one,
in God the Father and the Son Jesus Christ.
And so the saints were "`all baptized by one Spirit into one body,`"^
footnote:[1 Corinthians 12:13]
out of that nature in which are all differences, sects, and opinions,
and so come to put on Christ, who is but one.
"`For as many as are baptized into Christ have put on Christ,`"^
footnote:[Galatians 3:27]
with His love, His mind, affections, etc.
And these know a greater prize than contending about the basic elements of the world,
outward washings, and things that stand in times, seasons, customs, and persons.
For we find some are for sprinkling infants, others for dipping them,
some for this fashion and some for that,
all disputing and jangling from the written letter in imitation of John`'s ministry,
calling it the baptism of Christ.

And what is the effect of all these imitations and imaginations,
but a multitude of baptisms, religions and sects,
with every sect-master and his followers setting themselves
against all others in the way they conceive to be right.
So that now all must bow to their interpretations (which are all
different from each other) or else they are said to be in error.
Thus the form is set above the power, and not the true form either,
but only as men have conceived from the letter, or by the counsels of their own brain;
and thus are all scattered and divided in their
various imaginations and diverse baptisms.

And this was what Paul saw creeping in among the churches in his time,
setting up sects according to the person by whom they were baptized,
being puffed up for them, and against the other apostles, some of Paul, some of Peter,
some of Apollos, etc.
And Paul seeing this, thanked God he baptized no more than a few, plainly saying,
"`Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel,`"^
footnote:[1 Corinthians 1:17]
though he could make use of it until he saw them make an idol of it,
and by it to make divisions and parties, and to puff up one above another,
as it is now used today.
No, it is far worse today,
for now baptism with water is considered the key
to let in and shut out of what men call a church,
and some say none can be saved without it.

But if you knew the right end of John`'s ministration of water,
you would know that it was a forerunner of Christ`'s baptism and kingdom,
and a witness to all men that the Jews`' ceremonies, ordinances,
and worship (wherein they had grown into divisions), was to have an end,
and the spiritual ministration and baptism was to be set up in
the downfall of carnal ordinances and elements.
Indeed, from all of this they were to repent,
for the kingdom of God was at hand--even _within_ all that would believe.
And those who believed came in time to deny all the Jews`' worship,
with their outward circumcision and ordinances in the letter,
and instead preached the mystery and end of these things in Spirit.

But your baptisms now we are constrained to deny,
for they do not bring you to the end of tithes and offerings and other Jewish ceremonies.
And though we know that if we would but bow to your various forms of baptism and worship,
and to men`'s wills therein, we would not suffer by you.
Yet then the offense of the cross would cease (as it
has ceased to all who preach baptisms,
carnal ordinances, respect of persons, conformity to men`'s wills,
the world`'s customs and manners,
and the doctrine of imperfection and sin for term of life).
But for this same reason the first Christians suffered
all the envy that the Jews could heap unto them,
who upheld the form in the letter but denied the power and Spirit.

And so I say to all who can conform to the ways of men and please them:
The cross of Christ has ceased in you, and so has the power.
For this reason you are ever preaching against the world`'s ways and wickedness,
but never able to lead out of them.
You are like those who mind earthly things, who are enemies to the cross of Christ,
ever learning and teaching but never able to come to
the knowledge of the truth that makes free.
And in whomever the cross (with its sufferings) has ceased, these,
together with the powers of the earth,
are united against all who take up the cross to follow Christ in the way of the Spirit.

Therefore I say to all concerning baptisms just
what the apostle has said of circumcision:
'`We are the baptism, who worship God in the Spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus,
and have no confidence in the flesh,
though we might have confidence in the outward washing,
as we have formerly received it from such as gathered it from tradition.`'^
footnote:[See Philippians 3:3-4]
But this we have learned, '`that it is not the baptism which is outward in the flesh,
but the baptism which is in the Spirit, and not in the letter,
whose praise is not of men but of God.`'^
footnote:[See Romans 2:28-29]
By this baptism we are "`baptized by one Spirit into one body;`"^
footnote:[1 Corinthians 12:13]
and "`as many as are baptized into Christ, are baptized into His death,`"^
footnote:[Romans 6:3]
and have put Him on, and are become new creatures.
And this is the baptism which avails to save us--"`not the washing the flesh,
but the answer of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.`"^
footnote:[1 Peter 3:21]

And with regard to _this_ baptism we witness the truth that,
"`Whosoever believes and is baptized will be saved.`"^
footnote:[Mark 16:16]
But as for other baptisms, about which men are contending from the letter,
we see their end and what they bring forth.
Now if any should come forth in the power and Spirit of John`'s baptism,
or have a call from God thereto, such we will not judge or oppose.
But to suggest that any has power from the written letter to take
up John`'s water baptism and impose it upon others,
that I deny.
Or to say that leaving the outward shadow and going on to the spiritual baptism,
is a slighting or contemning of an ordinance of God, that I also deny;
for this might have been charged against Paul as well,
who ceased to baptize with water in his time,
and preached a baptism in Spirit in its stead.
And it is for this same thing that we are persecuted today,
who are not sent to dip or sprinkle with water
but to preach the gospel of light and life,
and the spiritual baptism of Christ Jesus,
for the bringing in of all who receive our testimony into one body, by one Spirit,
not making divisions about carnal things.
Indeed, for us the day has come, and the shadows have flown away.

And this I say to those who seek to know the truth of the matter:
We do not despise any ordinance of God into which He
has called any of His people in any generation;
but neither dare we take a tradition upon us which God has not required at our hands,
lest we keep people in that from which God has departed, and it be said to us,
"`Who has required it at your hands?`"^
footnote:[Isaiah 1:12]
And indeed, God has shown us a more excellent way: The light has come,
and therein we have found Christ Jesus, the guide of His people, and the leader of ages.
Yes, we have found the Spirit of truth,
who leads into all truth and into all that God requires,
the obedience to which is better than sacrifice.
And it is to this Spirit that we are sent to direct the people,
that Christ may be all in all,
who gives power in the creature to perform all that He leads into.
Hereby all who believe in the light may learn Him, who begets both the will and the deed,
and who is the author and finisher of faith in those who look to Him alone.
And it is by a measure of His Spirit which we have received that we can also see you,
who read what the saints did by a call from God,
and then set yourselves to do the like in imitation,
in self-righteousness and will-worship,
both in baptism and in all other things into which you have not been led by the Lord.
But this I say, that the Father has given His Son for a leader and guide to all ages,
both into and out of all forms as He pleases, in His way and time, in every generation.

It is for this reason that all who know God`'s will in this matter,
cannot endure to see any visible thing set up which limits His leading in Spirit,
or His people from following in Spirit.
Therefore, we deny no outward forms into which Christ leads by His Spirit;
but we deny all forms that are imposed by men to keep people from following the Spirit.
For the children of God are those who are led by the Spirit of God;
but those who are led by the letter alone have ever been their enemies.
It is the spiritual (and not the written) ministration that gives the knowledge of God,
and His glory and power.
He that is born after the flesh has his way in visible things,
but he that is born after the Spirit has food that the world does not know.
And what state are you in,
you who set up the shadow to oppose the substance (which is the end of the shadow),
and take hold of the letter to oppose the Spirit,
which writings were given to declare the sufficiency of the Spirit?
So you pervert the Scriptures out of their place
and end (which are given to testify of Christ,
their life and their end),
and set them in the place of Christ and think to have life in them.
And in this state, both Scriptures and ordinances and all the other gifts of God,
are abused, wrested out of their places, and made unprofitable.

=== Concerning the Lord`'s Supper

This is the thing that the professors of
religion are contending about in all the world;
and indeed, it is a great mystery to those who have not yet seen the Lord.
But since the mystery of iniquity began to work,
the world`'s teachers and professors (having lost their
dwelling in the body of Christ) have run out into imaginations,
and are so far from the life of this supper that they have lost the form and
the first institution of the shadow as it was performed by Christ.
And truly,
they are now so far from being made one in the blood of
Christ through the Lord`'s supper (so-called),
that they are shedding one another`'s blood in their contentions about the form.

Now this was done by Christ as they sat at a meal and ate the Passover,
and drank the cup that He gave them,
and so often as they did eat and drink thereof they were to do it in remembrance of Him,
"`showing His death till He came.`"^
footnote:[1 Corinthians 11:26]
And this mystery is what the apostles received of the Lord,
and was so practiced in the purity of the church (before
they ran into confusion) by those who continued steadfastly in the
apostles`' doctrine and fellowship,
"`daily breaking bread from house to house,
and eating their food with gladness and singleness of heart,`"^
footnote:[Acts 2:46]
in the fear and favor of God.
And this was to be done at all seasons, whenever they ate and drank;
for in their eating and drinking they were to do it unto the Lord,
and therein to have communion with His body and His blood,
and to keep themselves pure from all pollution, not eating at the table of the heathen,
whose feasting is in their lusts.

And so to keep from indulgence and feasting in lust,
they were to eat in remembrance of Christ`'s death till He came; who, when He comes,
takes the ordering and government of the creature upon His shoulders,
and so ever keeps them out of lust and excess in all that they do.
And so the creation is restored and reconciled to God
at the coming or appearing of Jesus Christ.
So the disciples were charged to wait for His coming at Jerusalem,
and did show forth His death as often as they broke bread, till He came.
And after He had come to the apostles,
they continued in condescension for the sake of those who were weak in the faith,
to whom Christ had not yet appeared, breaking bread from house to house,
and eating with singleness of heart.

For this reason Paul exhorted that both in their eating and drinking,
they should do all to the glory of God, and warned of the contrary.
And Jude saw how some had crept in among the churches,
and "`turned the grace of God into lewdness`"^
footnote:[Jude 1:4]
walking after their own hearts`' lusts,
whereby they defiled the flesh and lived in sensuality.
These, not having the Spirit to govern them,
"`fed themselves without fear,`" and were "`spots in their love feasts,`"
who being once enlightened and again giving way to lust and excess,
"`became twice dead, plucked up by the roots,`"^
footnote:[Jude 1:12]
though they had "`great swelling words.`"^
footnote:[Jude 1:16]

And of such there are many examples at this day,
who have known something quickened in them to hope for the appearance of the Lord,
but then fullness and excess have overtaken them for lack of eating
always in fear and in the remembrance of His coming.
And so these become dead again to any hope of His appearance at present,
and so put His coming afar off into another world;
yet they continue contending about the shadows or figures of His coming,
according as they have imagined.
But to avoid this the Lord Jesus commanded His disciples in a figure,
that in eating and drinking they should show forth His death till He came.
And these gave example and warning to those who were convinced,
that in all fear and moderation they might wait for His appearances,
telling them "`to let their moderation be known to all men, for the Lord is at hand.`"^
footnote:[Philippians 4:5]

But now those who live in the liberty of the flesh and
in outward observations put this coming afar off,
though they have a day every year to go into their
building and eat bread and wine in self-made solemnity;
or perhaps once a month, or three times a year,
some affirming the body and blood of Christ to be in the
creature after the supper is consecrated (as they say);
some saying, no! but it is spiritual before consecration; others saying,
no! it is natural and not changed because of words, etc.
So that one imagines the body of Christ to be real in it,
and another says it is only real by faith (as they call it), but all agree in this:
that after their eating and drinking they return to
their pleasures in the flesh and fashions of the world,
there to eat and drink to their delight and spend themselves on their lusts.

So it is with all who do not discern His body in their eatings,
who cling to their observations, and say He is always to come, or is past.
But the carnal eye, that sticks in visible things,
can never see Him who is present to lead the creation out from lust.
And so their eating is not the supper of the Lord,
nor does He sup with them in the new kingdom;
but in the old lustful spirit such become a table of the devil,
where the creation is sacrificed to his use.
So he keeps them in the observation of a day or a form, which they think is worship,
but he continues to bear rule in their whole lives by his spirit.
And from here come all manner of lewdness and lightness, strife, fighting, lawsuits,
and violence, sports, and vanities, too many here to mention,
all of which the creation spends itself upon, and for which they shall give an account.

Therefore, for the sake of those who are lost in this thing,
and troubled in mind concerning it, what I have received I shall declare unto you:
If you intend to sup with the Lord, or show forth the Lord`'s death till He come,
let your eating and drinking of all things, as often as you do it,
be in the remembrance of Him, and in His fear,
that you may witness a death to all lust and excess,
which indeed is that which has slain the Lamb from the foundation of the world,
and is the great enemy of His appearance,
and is that by which He is spiritually crucified in the "`great city
which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt.`"^
footnote:[Revelation 11:8]
For all you that "`live in pleasure on the earth and are wanton;
you that nourish your hearts as in the day of slaughter;
you have condemned and murdered the Just One, and He does not resist you.`"^
footnote:[James 5:5]
And so you must know a death to all this before you can sup with the Lord, or He with you.
But if you eat in remembrance of Him, and so come to die to that which slew Him,
then you do show forth the Lord`'s death till He come;
and when He comes He shall not find you "`eating and drinking with the drunken,
nor beating your fellow servants.`"^
footnote:[Matthew 24:49]

And this is known from the Lord in the
eternal light to be the true end of the supper of the Lord,
that at His coming all may be found fit to receive Him;
which appearance they who feed without fear do deny, and crucify afresh to themselves.
And therefore in another place, speaking of His coming, He warns them to "`take heed,
lest at any time their hearts be weighed down with
carousing and drunkenness and the cares of this life,
and so that Day come upon them unaware, and so become a snare to them.`"^
footnote:[Luke 21:34]
For so it is to all who are in this state when He appears to them,
and so they cannot receive the day of His visitation,
for their hearts have gone out into carnal things.

=== Concerning Redemption

There are many who boast and glory in redemption,
who know nothing more than words and imaginations.
Indeed, few have come so far as to know what it is that needs redemption,
and what the promise is to, and in what Seed^
footnote:[Footnote by George Whitehead:
"`The seed is mentioned in a twofold sense:
the seed which is Christ who redeems,
and the seed of Abraham, i.e. believers, whom He redeems.
The children of the promise are counted for the seed.`"]
it is seen and received.
For there is a Seed in which the promise of redemption is made to the soul,
but all who take delight in sin and in fleshly liberty are of a contrary seed.
These see no need of redemption, but are at ease in their sin;
they need no physician for they say they are not sick,
but all their talk of redemption little changes their true state.

But if you find something in you that, in the midst of all worldly delights,
cries '`vanity and emptiness!`' and can find no satisfaction therein,
nor conform to this world or take pleasure in wickedness;
if there is something that dares not contend for sin but
instead cries '`woe to you!`' because of your wickedness,
and mourns because of the abominations of your times;
and if you find something that breathes towards God for
life and strength against all vanity and evil,
and desires to follow Christ out of the world; I say,
if such a Seed you find in yourself, though it be the least of all seeds,
yet this is the Seed of the kingdom, to which the promise is made.
And no further than this Seed is raised up to reign in you above all that is contrary,
are you redeemed by Christ Jesus.
For this is the plant of God`'s renown, the lily among the thorns,
which is choked by the cares of this world,
and the deceitfulness of riches and pleasures, that it may not bring forth fruit to God.
But God has placed this Seed in you for Himself,
that therein He might teach you to profit,
and that from it you might receive wisdom and strength, yes,
all that is needful for you in the measure to which you are called.

And this Seed lying oppressed and veiled under your lusts
and pleasures is the reason you know not the Father or the Son,
for to the spiritual birth He is revealed.
And though you talk of redemption, yet you know not God, nor His power, life,
or presence to guide you out of evil,
and to give you victory over the prince of this world, but are captivated at his will,
to do his works, and so are under the condemnation that he is in.
And all your talk of redemption does not deliver you from his baits,
but into temptation you continually fall, committing the sin that he leads you into,
and so remain sons of the devil.

But the Seed that is of God lies under all of this,
and suffers below in death and captivity,
when the bonds of iniquity are over you.
And for this reason you cannot receive His power, His promise, or His salvation,
which are all placed in the Seed; for while you remain in your delights,
the Seed is not of you or with you, but rather against you.
Indeed, in this state you are not of the promised Seed, but an enemy to it,
and are sinning against it by your lusts and pleasures and self-will.
Thus you are in Pharaoh`'s nature and state,
who keeps the Seed of God in the house of bondage,
and does not pity or regard its cries.
For truly, it cries against your pride and excess, your envy and wrath,
and all the wickedness by which you oppress the Seed in that state where death reigns.
And for this reason the wrath of God comes upon the world of iniquity,
who are enemies to the Seed of the covenant, not being joined to it,
but are joined to a seed of a contrary nature.

But all who are joined in the light to the Seed of God
partake of the love and life that are in Christ Jesus.
And all who know this Seed quickened and raised in the heart by the Spirit of Jesus,
know "`the plant of God`'s renown,`"^
footnote:[Ezekiel 34:29]
the plant of God`'s own planting, in which the fruit of the Spirit is found.
Such as these know where to wait for the supply of all needs,
and for counsel in all difficulties;
where the law that is spiritual and the righteousness of faith are received.
Yes, it is in this Seed that men are redeemed,
and the saints have fellowship in light with the Father and the Son,
and find all the gifts and graces whereby the creature becomes free
from the law of sin that they may be married to Christ.
And having been set free from the service of sin
and Satan they are free to serve the living God.
And this is their freedom: even the righteousness that is eternal,
which is known as the soul is redeemed out of the pit of corruption.
For where this Seed has risen up, there the creature receives from God of His fullness;
but where the Seed is in the tomb, there the curse remains and sin and trespasses reign.
Yes, when the Seed has arisen within and the immortal birth is born,
then the creature is blessed of God for the Seed`'s sake,
and it is in this Seed that God is truly worshiped.
But wherever death still reigns, there the sacrifice of man is an abomination,
for they that are dead cannot praise God.

Therefore, this I say to all who find this holy thing moving in
you against your lusts and worldly pleasures:
take heed,
and do not deceive yourselves with a talk of redemption while this
Seed lies in prison and has not risen above all your lusts.
But wait in the light of Christ which lets you see this,
so that you may witness His power to raise His
Seed above everything in you that is contrary,
and so you shall reign with Him over all the world and its wicked ways.
But if you have found this breathing towards God in your soul, and yet pay it no regard,
take heed lest He that gave it for your salvation take it from you again^
footnote:["`'`So take the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten talents.`'
For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance;
but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.`"
(Matt. 25:28-29)]
and leave you to your lusts without reproof,
for His Spirit will not always strive with you.^
footnote:[Genesis 6:3]
And then it would be better had you never been born.
Alas, this has been the lot of many who,
after receiving many reproofs and stirrings towards good,
are now left to fill up their measure of sin with greediness,
who now glory in their shame and boast of their filthiness.
And oh, His day is coming upon many more who now little mind
the measure of God`'s grace moving in them,
but live in their lusts, sinning against their conscience for selfish ends,
and yet please themselves with a talk of redemption.
For the common profession now taken up by many is to make the
redemption of Christ a cover for immorality and fleshly liberty;
but all who know the redemption of Christ by His
precious blood are redeemed out from all vain conduct,
and into the holy conduct of Him that has called them to be holy.
For the redemption which is in Christ Jesus is "`to purge the
conscience from dead works to serve the living God.`"^
footnote:[Hebrews 9:14]
For this end "`He gave Himself for us, to redeem us from all iniquity,
and to purify unto Himself a peculiar people zealous of good works.`"^
footnote:[Titus 2:14]
And He has "`redeemed us to God by His blood, out of kindreds, tongues,`"^
footnote:[Revelation 5:9]
and out of every sinful nation, to follow the Lamb, and not to follow worldly lusts.

So then, with the light of Christ which lets you see your transgressions,
search your hearts,
that you may see if the righteous Seed that moves you to righteousness is
not oppressed and burdened by the seed of the evildoer,
and by that nature which loves carnal delights.
For if you are still led captive to do the works of Satan,
what redemption do you have more than a talk?
It is like a man that has an imagination of eating, but still is hungry;
so you imagine freedom, but still serve sin.
And while you remain servants of sin you are free from righteousness,
just as he that is a servant of righteousness is free from sin.
It is an easy thing to imagine righteousness and redemption,
but "`he that does righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous.`"^
footnote:[1 John 3:7]
And this is not known while the Seed of God lies
oppressed beneath your lusts and not regarded.

=== Concerning Justification, Sanctification and Mortification

The wisdom of men in the fall, having found these three words in Scripture,
has in the imagination divided and separated that which is one,
and which cannot be divided in man`'s possession;
for it is one Spirit that works all of these wherever He is present,
according to the measure received.
And this is the Righteous One, who by faith lives in the creature,
and the creature lives in Him,
and so becomes the justifier and sanctifier of all that believe,
and the mortifier of that nature which is outside of the faith,
so that one of these things cannot be found without the rest.
For the power which sanctifies also mortifies, and the same justifies;
and all who know what it is to possess these in life know these things.

Now there is a people whose desire for heaven
is more than their desire for holiness,
and lest they should spoil their carnal delights,
they have conceived (in the imagination of their brains) a
justification without sanctification or mortification,
wresting those scriptures which condemn the works of the law,
and by them seeking also to exclude the righteousness of faith.
And because the Scripture says God
justifies or pardons the ungodly through faith,
they therefore conclude themselves justified in their ungodliness by a belief which
they call faith (though they are without the true faith in Christ).
For that faith which does not lay hold of God`'s righteousness is not the faith of Christ,
but rather a dead thing;
for the true faith of Christ reveals a righteousness apart from the law,
from faith to faith, and also lives in it.
So men are justified as they are sanctified and mortified, and no further.
And where there is no righteousness, there is no true faith in Christ;
but where God`'s righteousness is working in the creature,
there a true belief is witnessed and faith is shown by works.
But the "`faith without works is dead,`"^
footnote:[James 2:20]
being alone, for "`as the body without the spirit is dead,
so faith without works is dead also,`"^
footnote:[James 2:26]
and so is your justification dead without holiness and mortification of sin.
And you will find in the end that that in you which
justifies the wicked is the same that condemns the just,
and both are an abomination to the Lord.^
footnote:[Proverbs 17:15]
But this is your state,
you who contend for sin and live in pleasure and carelessness on the earth; yes,
you crucify the just and holy One and save the unjust from death.
Thus you prove you know not Him who is just, who also justifies, mortifies, sanctifies,
and redeems.

And although the Scriptures mention these three,
this is not so that men will divide them and make
people believe they may have one and not all,
but to show the various effects of the one work of man`'s redemption,
which are all wrought by one power in the creature.
For it is the blood and Spirit of Christ that washes away the filth,
and so puts off the old man, and mortifies the deeds of the body,
and so sanctifies and justifies, yet none of these without man`'s obedience,
being works of faith and not of self.
For by the law of faith all self-sanctification, self-mortification,
and self-justification are excluded,
these being the work of God wrought by Christ in the believer,
who must also join to it in faith and obedience.
For God will work in all who believe in the light that they may receive His Son,
in whom is the promise and the power unto mortification, sanctification,
and justification.
But such who would share in His justification without
obedience and fellowship in His sufferings,
are such as are justified in a dream, while sin still reigns,
and the unrighteous one lives and acts in them.
Indeed, this is but self seeking to justify self,
though man remains dead in trespasses and sins, and not just before God.

But the saints suffered the loss of all things,
counting them as dross and dung that they "`might know Him,
and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings,
being made conformable to His death.`"^
footnote:[Philippians 3:10]
Through death, these came to the power and fellowship of His resurrection,
whereby they were justified, being raised with Him to newness of life;
and by faith they received the gift of God`'s righteousness and became servants thereto,
and thereby free from sin.
This is the true justification, where there is no condemnation,
where the deeds of the flesh are mortified,
and the creature walks no more after the flesh but after the Spirit.
For the condemnation is to all who walk after the flesh;
but he that walks in the Spirit is justified,
for he no longer fulfills the lusts of the flesh.
And in these a mortification is witnessed to the nature which breaks the law,
and the Righteous One is known who fulfills the law in such as walk not after the flesh,
but after the Spirit.
So, "`it is not the hearers of the law that are just before God,
but the doers of the law shall be justified.`"^
footnote:[Romans 2:13]

Now in the first or earthly man`'s state, the law is broken,
and mortification and sanctification are denied.
Here men would be justified from the guilt of sin but not from the love and power of sin.
Yes, they would have their carnal delights both in the world and in heaven also;
but this vain hope will perish.
But in the second man`'s state the law is fulfilled through mortification, sanctification,
and justification of the Spirit.
And no man can be justified where the Righteous One does not live;
for that by which the just shall live is that by which the creature is justified.

=== Concerning the Law

All who know not the ministration of the Spirit are confounded concerning the law.
For going to the Scriptures and finding there mentioned a
ministration of the letter and a ministration of the Spirit,
and they themselves being under neither of these (except in their imaginations,
or in notions they have received, but not from the mouth of the Lord),
some say they are under the law and that it continues still;
others say only the part that is moral continues; others say, no,
but it is all done away, and they are not under any ministration of law but under grace;
and so by their pretended faith they make void the law, not knowing what they say herein.
And truly, this is all that they know, either of the law or the gospel,
who read the letter in their carnal wisdom, and imagine what is law and what is grace,
not knowing the Spirit by which these were ministered to the saints,
who had the law written in their hearts, and grace there also.
Such do know that the one does not make void the other, but rather establishes the other;
for the coming of Christ was not to nullify the law but to fulfill it.
Yes, He did not come to put the law afar off, but to bring it near,
that with His light all may see it as it is written in the heart by the living God.
And so far is He from destroying or taking away the law,
that He establishes it in its force and purity, saying,
that "`one jot or tittle should not pass away till it be fulfilled.`"^
footnote:[Matthew 5:18]

And whereas it was said in the letter,
"`You shall not commit adultery,`" He says, "`You shall not lust.`"
In the letter it was said, "`You shall not swear falsely;`"
but in the Spirit, He says, "`Swear not at all.`"
In the letter, "`You shall not kill;`" but in the Spirit,
"`You shall not be angry;`" and whosoever does any of these things is guilty before God.
Now, far from making void the law, the Spirit declares it in its purity,
so that even those who might seem to be clear in the letter,
may be found guilty according to the law of the Spirit.
Thus by Christ Jesus (who is the end of that law) all may see their condemnation,
and by faith in Him come to be set free, not by the blood of bulls and goats,
and the ashes of a heifer, and outward sacrifices, temples, altars, days,
or Sabbaths in the letter, but by all of these in Spirit,
which are in Christ Jesus ministered to the soul and conscience,
to wash away sin, and "`purge the conscience from dead works to serve the living God,`"^
footnote:[Hebrews 9:14]
which the ministration of the letter and carnal ordinances could not do.

And this is the reason why the ministration of the letter was done away:
because it could not make perfect the ones drawing near,
as pertaining to the conscience.^
footnote:[Hebrews 9:9; 10:1]
So the ministration of the Spirit is preached in its stead,
which gives perfect knowledge of sin and perfect redemption from it,
and from all things from which the outward law could not deliver.
For though the letter may show a man his condemnation, yet it cannot give life;^
footnote:[Galatians 3:21]
it can show the duty, but does not give power to perform it, for "`the letter kills,
but the Spirit giveth life.`"^
footnote:[2 Corinthians 3:6]

So it is that many read their duty in the
letter but lack power to perform what they read,
and so set up imaginations instead of performance; some saying the law is done away,
and now none are condemned by it; others saying Christ fulfilled it in His own person,
and we need only to believe what He did sixteen-hundred years ago; others say, no,
but we must do all that we can of what the Scriptures command, and He will do the rest;
and still others that whatever we do He makes it accepted with the Father,
for Christ performed all that is required.
But none of these know God`'s command in Spirit,
which gives both life and power to perform all that is required.
And this cannot be known by reading of what others did while
you still lack the Spirit and power by which they acted.
For when you take the law upon yourself without the Spirit of life,
a self-righteousness is begotten by the letter.
In this sense the "`law was weak through the flesh,`"^
footnote:[Romans 8:3]
but the power of the law is known by all who receive it in Spirit and life.
For the law is fulfilled in Spirit and not in letter; in Christ and not in self;
by faith and not by works; in the everlasting righteousness of God,
freely given and received by faith, and revealed in the creature from faith to faith.
The law in the letter gives a knowledge of sin;
but the law in the Spirit gives not only the knowledge of sin,
but the knowledge of God and His righteousness
in Christ Jesus for the fulfilling of the law,
which is life eternal, according to His promise:
"`I will write My law in your hearts and put it in your inward parts,
and you shall all know Me, from the greatest to the least.`"^
footnote:[Jeremiah 31:33-34]

So then, all you who know only commands in the written letter,
from there you may fetch your own condemnation,
but from there you cannot fetch power for obedience and justification of life.
For from within flows life in the Spirit, and not from without in the letter.
And here is "`the change of the law`"^
footnote:[Hebrews 7:12]
to that which is spiritual--to a spiritual priesthood, a spiritual temple,
a spiritual altar, circumcision, offering, blood, oracle, anointing, washings, etc.
Yes, all of their worship which was outward and could make nothing perfect,
has changed and become spiritual and inward; which "`brings in a better hope,`"^
footnote:[Hebrews 7:19]
being more pure and perfect than anything outward could be,
even as He is perfect.
Now "`the law was added because of transgression till the promised Seed should come,`"^
footnote:[Galatians 3:19]
of whom it is prophesied in types and figures.
This Seed is Christ, the end of the law to everyone that believes,
without respect of persons.
So that now God has written in the heart a law in Spirit,
whereby the transgressor is condemned in his own conscience.
Yes, this law is upon and against the first man, who is the transgressor,
and "`has dominion over that man as long as he lives,`"^
footnote:[Romans 7:1]
both judging, reproving, and condemning,
as well as prophesying of One who will come to
fulfill the law in everyone who obeys the light.
Thus the "`law is a schoolmaster to bring unto Christ;`"^
footnote:[Galatians 3:24]
but until He comes to fulfill it (who is the end of it),
there is condemnation upon the creature, because the pure law of God has been broken.
And all this is testified by the light in the conscience,
as a witness against the old man and his deeds
which are contrary to the perfect law of God.
And so by that which is perfect he is condemned who is imperfect,
wherever the image of God is lost, and death reigns because of trespasses and sins.

For God did not give a law to condemn His own work,
but rather the work of the devil.
And wherever the transgressor is, there is the work of the devil.
All his works are condemned by the law,
until the resurrection of the Seed and the image of God is witnessed,
when all things are subdued under Him who is the end of the law,
by whom the fruits of the Spirit are also brought forth,
"`against which there is no law.`"^
footnote:[Galatians 5:23]
And so by the Seed`'s resurrection and the virtue thereof,
the requirement of God in the conscience is answered,
and the creature is saved from the condemnation of the law of God.
But condemnation remains upon all where the Seed lies in the tomb,
and death reigns in the creature.

Therefore, the law that lays hold upon all transgressors, we witness to continue,
and to be spiritual, just, and good, given forth against the first man and his works,
whether good or bad (according as men call them).
Yes, though a man set himself to do the works of the law ever so zealously,
yet the pure law of God is a witness of condemnation against him in his conscience,
until the promised Seed has its birth and rise in him.
And this is not of the will of the first man, nor after the flesh, but after the Spirit,
which is one with the law, and according to the will and grace of God.

Now Israel according to the flesh received the law in
the literal ministration of carnal ordinances,
and from them Christ was to come, who was "`born of a woman, born under the law,
to redeem those who were under the law,`"^
footnote:[Galatians 4:4-5]
if they did believe.
Even so now, Israel according to the Spirit,
who receive the spiritual law that is written in the heart,
shall witness the Child born of the royal Seed, even the Heir of the promise,
for the fulfilling of the pure law of God.
And indeed there are many witnesses at this day who have
patiently waited in that which God has written in their hearts,
which is seen with the light of Christ.
These have received the faith of the gospel and the end of that faith,
even God`'s righteousness revealed from faith to faith,
whereby the pure law of God is fulfilled in many, and is being fulfilled in others,
who abide in their measure of faith which God has dealt to them, walking in the light,
not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
And so by the law of the Spirit of life which is in Christ Jesus,
these see themselves set free from the law of sin and death,
and so witness the power of the gospel.
But this you will never do,
you who cast the law of God behind your backs
and in your vain mind say you are not under it.
Truly, in the day of trial you will be found to be under its condemnation.

=== Concerning Christ Jesus

This is He of whom the world talks much, but few there are that know Him.
By Him all things were made, and He is the life of all creatures,
and was before all creatures, without beginning of days or end of life, a priest forever,
and a king whose dominion knows no end.
By Him kings reign, and dominions are cast down,
though they know Him not wherever self is standing.
He is hidden from the world`'s wisdom,
and the depth of man`'s prudence cannot find Him out,
but He reveals Himself to such as walk in His light,
which is contrary to all the dark paths of the world.
Yes, those who deny themselves may learn the way of the Lord,
for to these He freely reveals the way for their return,
that He may bring them down from the seat of exaltation and
make known to them the beginning from which they were dug.

He is the eternal Word,
who was glorified in the heavens with the Father before all time,
and then in time was made manifest.
For "`the Word became flesh and dwelt among us,`"^
footnote:[John 1:14]
and "`took upon Himself the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men;
and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to death,`"^
footnote:[Philippians 2:7-8]
that He might become a living example to all generations.
And having finished the work and offered Himself for
man`'s redemption (for which purpose He was begotten),
He ascended far above the heavens,
to prepare a place for all that follow Him by faith in His light;
and from there He appears as a Savior to all who eagerly wait for Him.
And truly, only those who know Him for their judge and lawgiver,
and who love Him and keep His commands, can know Him for their redeemer;
to such He comes, and the Father also, to "`make their abode with him.`"^
footnote:[John 14:23]

And this is He who is "`the light of the world,`"^
footnote:[John 8:12]
and "`enlightens every man that comes into the world;`"^
footnote:[John 1:9]
who "`stands at the door and knocks;
and if any hear His voice and open He will come in and sup with him.`"^
footnote:[Revelation 3:20]
Such as these know Him, and He knows those who hear His voice.
And these are quickened out of trespasses and sins,
and the Seed of God rises up over death in them.
But where Christ is rejected, death still reigns,
and the wisdom by which He is known is thought foolishness.

So if you desire to know Him who is not of this world,
but who was before the world was,
and is a witness against all the world`'s ways and wickedness,
then mind that light in you which shows you these things.
For just as Christ is, so is His light that leads to Him.
Yes, that which bears testimony against the world is not of the world,
even as He is not of the world, and so it leads out of the world unto Him;
but the world by its wisdom knows Him not.
And as any follow the light out of the world,
you will come to discern that Seed which is crucified by the world`'s wisdom and glory,
to which Seed are all the promises,
and in which are hidden the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
And as this Seed is raised up within by the same
Spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead,
so you shall see Him to whom all power and judgment is committed in heaven and earth,
whose flesh is the life of men, and His light is as a law that goes forth,
whereby man is led to his spiritual food,
and the sons of men see the way out of darkness.

And this is He who cannot be limited or restrained to one place,
but fills heaven and earth with His presence, and appears at His pleasure to His own,
and dwells in His saints, though the wise of the world know Him not,
and imagine His dwelling to be high above the stars.
These know Him not, and hating reproof they have put His day afar off,
that they may spend their days in folly, feed themselves with the wind,
and fill their hearts with carnal delights.
And even as the hearts of the children of light become established in grace,
these go on disputing about the body of Christ,
while the body of sin keeps its rule in them, whereby they are darkened and heart-blind,
past feeling the measure of God`'s grace,
with hearts weighed down by dissipation and cares of the world,
and minds corrupted with earthly things.

To such as these I say, cease from your imaginations,
for Christ only reveals Himself in Spirit to
such as wait in the light and love what is pure.
To these His appearance is like the sun, whose rising is not by the will of man.
Indeed, all must wait for His appearing,
if they desire to be saved and refreshed with the beams of His glory.
And to all who are still in the night I say this: He shall appear,
if you look towards the place of His rising, which is not,
"`Lo here,`" and "`Lo there;`" but within, in your hearts.
And all who have come to the "`sure Word of prophecy,
as to a light that shines in a dark place,
to which you do well to take heed till the day
dawn and the day-star arise in your hearts,`"^
footnote:[2 Peter 1:19]
you will indeed see this sun arise where the day-star appears in your hearts,
if you will but wait in the light that shines in the darkness.
And you will feel His virtue and life, and receive of the same.
Yes, you will see Him as He is, and know Him to be the "`Sun of Righteousness,
whose arising is with healing in His wings,`"^
footnote:[Malachi 4:2]
and whose breaking forth is upon all His enemies which have reigned over the Seed.
And truly His spiritual "`weapons are mighty
through God to the pulling down of strongholds,
casting down imaginations,
and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God,
and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Himself,
and having in readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.`"^
footnote:[2 Corinthians 10:4-6]

And thus the saints know the Son of God with His light, power,
and dominion over all things in heaven and in earth,
for He rules in righteousness in the hearts of His people,
trampling down Satan under their feet.
And though hypocrites call Him "`Lord, Lord,`" still they serve and obey the devil,
having the words of Christ but not knowing His light, His power,
His kingdom and dominion.
These have made the name of Christ a reproach among the nations,
who call Him a redeemer but still live in their sins.
But none know Jesus further than they know a savior from sin, and not a cover for sins;
for the promise of the Father is, "`He shall save His people _from_ their sins.`"^
footnote:[Matthew 1:21]

=== Concerning the Ministry of Christ

The true ministers of Christ are called out of
the world and are contrary to the world,
being contrary to their own wills and to the wills of all flesh.
For such who preach the Word are first begotten of the Word,
and so have been begotten contrary to the will of man.
And this is evident in all of the Scriptures,
and in the history of persecution in all ages to this day:
that whenever the mystery of iniquity had spread over the land,
and darkness passed over the Seed,
and God`'s people had broken His covenant and lost His Word,
then God (in love to His people) sent out those who had His Word in
them to bear witness for the Lord against all of their backsliding,
their self-ways and their formal worship.
And to such as these, the world`'s ministers have always been enemies,
and have sought to stir up the powers of men to devour them,
calling them blasphemers and heretics, destroyers of worship, peace-breakers,
and enemies to authority,
though indeed they were sent of God to testify against
false worship and to break the peace of the wicked one,
who keeps his house in peace till a stronger Man comes.
And you shall never find that any of God`'s ministers could join with the world`'s worship,
but instead cried against their priests, their prophets, their days, their times,
their places, etc., which had gone out from the Word and Spirit into the world.

And as the true ministers of Christ are called
out of the world and the things thereof,
so they are not concerned for the things of the world;
for He who is their master is also their maintainer.
Surely none of Christ`'s ministers ever preached for hire, nor prophesied for money,
nor lived upon tithes.
Nor were they called masters but rather servants and bond-slaves of Christ,
not commissioned by men but sent of God,
proving themselves to be ministers indeed in much patience, in affliction,
in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors,
in watchings, in fastings; by pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness,
by the Holy Spirit, by love unfeigned, by the Word of truth, by the power of God,
by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left; in honor and dishonor,
in evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true, as unknown and yet well-known,
as dying and yet living; chastened, sorrowful, poor, having nothing,
wandering up and down, having no certain dwelling-place.

And these, having that Word in them in which is all fullness,
need not study what to preach, or steal words from another,
like those who speak words in their own will and time,
who talk against pride and yet live in it;
who preach against sin but cannot cease from it.
Yes, the ministers of the world who are commissioned by men confess Christ in words,
but in works deny Him.
And because of their pride, pleasures, and carnal ends,
they have changed the Lord`'s worship from what it once was, both in matter and manner,
means and maintenance, and so have scattered the Lord`'s people into sects and opinions,
forms, customs and traditions in every nation according as best suits their wills.
To these I say: your own ways testify to your face, and before all men,
that you are no more like the ministers of Christ than
those who walked in the same steps before you.
So search the Scriptures, and search your hearts with the light of Christ,
and count me not your enemy for telling you the truth.
I have only cleared my conscience in love to your souls,
though such as are deceived through blind zeal and envy cannot receive it.
